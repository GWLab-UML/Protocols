## Routine DNase treatment
*Note:* this protocol is for samples that contain <= 200 ug nucleic acid per uL. Use 1 uL TURBO DNase for up to 10 ug of RNA in a 50 uL reaction. These conditions will remove up to 2 ug of genomic DNA from total RNA in a 50 uL reaction. If there is more RNA (>200 ug nucleic acid per mL) that is severely contaminated with DNA (i.e., >2 ug DNA/50uL), use the **rigorous DNase treatment** (see below)

#### Prep
- set incubator to 37ºC
- UV RNA-free 1.5mL tubes and label

#### Protocol
1. Add 0.1 volume 10X TURBO DNase buffer and 1uL of TURBO DNase enzyme to the RNA, mix gently
2. Incubate at 37ºC for 30 minutes
3. Resuspend the DNase inactivation reagent by flicking or vortexing the tube before use
	>*Note:* The DNase Inactivation Reagent may become difficult to pipette after multiple uses due to depletion of fluid from the interstitial spaces. If this happens, add a volume of Nuclease-free Water (supplied with the kit) equal to approximately 20–25% of the bed volume of the remaining DNase Inactivation Reagent, and vortex thoroughly to recreate a pipettable slurry.
4. Add resuspended DNase inactivation reagent (2 uL or 0.1 volume, whichever is greater), then mix well
	>**IMPORTANT!** always use at least 2 uL of DNase inactivation reagent, even if it is more than 0.1 volume
5. incubate the sample for 5 minutes at room temperature. Flick the tube 2-3 times during the incubation period to keep the DNase inactivation reagent suspended.
	>*Note:* If room temperature cools below 22–26°C, move the tubes to a heat block or oven to control the temperature. Cold environments can inhibit inactivation of the TURBODNase Enzyme, leaving residual DNase in the RNA sample.
6. Centrifuge the samples at 10,000g for 1.5 minutes, then carefully transfer the supernatant containing the RNA to a fresh tube. Do not disturb the DNase inactivation reagent pellet.
