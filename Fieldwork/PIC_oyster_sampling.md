## Wild oyster sampling
*All water chemistry and samples should be taken adjacent to the oyster bed and done first, prior to oyster collection, to avoid disturbing the water column. Everything should be stored and transported in a cold cooler.*
### A. Prep
- Orion + pH calibration buffers
	- Bring extra DI water to rinse probe
	- Bring extra electrode storage solution
- Soft cooler with ice packs
- 2x sterile 250mL nalgenes (per site) - ==to buy==
- 4x 250mL amber nalgenes (per site)
- ==PVC quadrat==
- Mesh bag
- Small ziplock bag
- Metal clippers
- Ruler
- Sharpie
### B. Field
1. Take salinity, pH, temperature, and DO water measurements using Orion
2. Collect 200mL water microbiome sample in sterile nalgene (Rep A)
3. Collect another 200mL water microbiome sample in sterile nalgene at a different location relative to the oyster bed (Rep B)
4. Collect 200mL surface and 200mL subsurface (6-12" deep) chlorophyll a samples using amber nalgenes (Rep A)
	- Keep bottle closed until submerged about elbow-deep, open the bottle to fill with water, recap while still under water at the same depth
5. Collect another set of 200mL surface and 200mL subsurface chlorophyll a samples at a different location relative to the oyster bed using amber nalgenes (Rep B)
6. Take 6x haphazardly thrown quadrat pictures of oyster bed
	- Make sure to keep the camera level and capture the whole quadrat
	- Try to keep shadows to a minimum
7. Collect 30 subtidal adult oysters (==1.5-3"==) in mesh bag
	- Gather from all around the bed
	- Try not to select for oysters that are more easily removed—use the snips to pry off oysters attached to rocks or other oysters
8. Collect 10 subtidal juvenile oysters (==<1.5"==) in small ziplock bag

## Farmed oyster sampling
*Coordinate with farmers ahead of time—text a reminder a week or so in advance. Everything should be stored and transported in a cold cooler.*
### A. Prep
- Orion + pH calibration buffers
	- Bring extra DI water to rinse probe
	- Bring extra electrode storage solution
- Soft cooler with ice packs
- 2x sterile 250mL nalgenes (per site) - ==to buy==
- 4x 250mL amber nalgenes (per site)

*Vacuum setup*
- Vacuum pump + tubing
- 2x 1L vacuum flask
- 2x glass funnels 
- 2x glass cups
- 2x metal clamps
==*Salinity check*== - necessary? not if we take water chemistry at farms/have sensors deployed
- Refractometer
- DI squirt bottle
- Kimwipes
- 200uL pipette + autoclaved tips
- Small tri-corner beaker (for waste)

- 2x forceps
- 2x beakers (for sterilization)
==*Cleaning*==
- 2x large tri-corner beakers
- Bleach
- DI water
- Microfiber cloths

==include picture of setup==

### B. Filter 
1. Using a sterile pipette tip and the refractometer, measure and record salinity of replicate on data sheet
	- Start with microbiome samples, then proceed to chlorophyll a 
2. Rinse refractometer with DI water and dry with a kimwipe
3. Attach 1L vacuum flask to pump and insert glass funnel
4. Using sterile (ethanol-flamed) forceps, place white filter paper on top of funnel and secure using glass cup and metal clamp
	- For microbiome water samples, use 0.22um filter paper
	- For chlorophyll a samples, use 0.7um filter paper
5. Pour 200mL of replicate into glass cup and turn on the pump
6. Once all of the liquid has filtered into the flask, remove the metal clamp and carefully lift off the glass cup
7. Using two pairs of sterile (ethanol-flamed) forceps, carefully fold the filter paper
	- For microbiome water samples, fold in half four times or until it can fit into a labeled 2mL tube of RNAlater—make sure it is fully submerged
	- For chlorophyll a samples, fold in half once and then carefully wrap in a labeled sleeve of tinfoil
8. Clean the glass funnel and glass cup between each replicate by rinsing it in 5-10% bleach  followed by DI water at least twice
	- There are two sets of glass funnels and cups so that while one is drying, another can be used to continue processing
9. Repeat steps 1-7 until all water samples have been filtered
	- **Watch the water level in the vacuum flask**—after 3-4 samples it should be disconnected from the pump and the contents dumped down the sink! 
10. Return all microbiome 2mL tubes to the correctly labeled freezer box and collect all chlorophyll a tinfoil sleeves into a Ziplock bag and put on ice (long-term storage at -80ºC)
11. Thoroughly rinse all the nalgenes in the sink, give them a final rinse with DI water, and then let air dry

### B. Shucking and tissue pictures
1. Scrub all oysters in the sink to remove excess mud
2. Spray working area with bleach
3. Using sterile (ethanol-flamed) shucking knives, shuck oyster and arrange face-up on a weigh boat
4. Repeat step 2 with a second oyster
5. Take a photo of the tray ==example picture==
6. Fill in site, date, oyster_num, and initials on the data sheet
7. Upload all photos to the appropriate folder in the lab google drive before leaving
### C. Tissue dissection
1. Using sterile (ethanol-flamed) forceps and dissecting scissors, take a small sample of the oyster mantle and put into appropriate RNAlater tube
2. Repeat step 1, taking samples of gill, gonad, stomach contents, and digestive gland
	- Gonad appears as a creamy organ often lying above the digestive gland ==picture==
	- Stomach is sampled by gently expressing the stomach contents from the rectum using sterile forceps and then pipetting the contents into the RNAlater tube ==picture==
	- Digestive gland is the often brown textured tissue—try to minimize the amount of stomach included in the sample by trimming off any attached pale tissue ==picture==
3. Check off tissue types on the data sheet, or make a note if no sample was taken
	- Remove any unused tubes from the rack
### D. Perkinsus dissection
1. Using sterile (ethanol-flamed) forceps and dissecting scissors, take a small sample of the oyster mantle and put it into a glass culture tube pre-filled with RFTM
	- Try to take a piece of mantle that includes some of the black fringe to easily distinguish  between tissue types later post-incubation
2. Take an additional clipping of the rectum (1-2cm) and put it in the same tube
3. Label the tube with the oyster number using sharpie
4. Add a 2-3 drops of nystatin suspension
5. Check off *Perkinsus* tissue types on the data sheet, or make a note if no sample was taken
### E. Histology sampling
>for more details, see [full histology protocol](https://github.com/GWLab-UML/Protocols/blob/main/Oyster_labwork/Histology_slide_prep.md)
0. Before processing begins, create a working solution of Davidson's Fixative by adding 50mL glacial acetic acid to 450mL of Davidson's Fixative. Add ~10mL of working solution to each 15mL canonical tube. **This must be done (preferably) in a fume hood or in a well-ventilated space such as outdoors.**
> bring extra tubes/fixative to sample extra oysters that appear diseased
1. Using a sharp scalpel or dissecting scissors, remove a cross-section of oyster tissue that includes most of the tissue types (gill, mantle, gut, gonad, etc.), along the blue lines in the image below. ![[image.png]]
2. Place tissue in the corresponding labeled canonical tube with working solution of Davidson's Fixative (fixative + glacial acetic acid). Ensure tissue is fully submerged in liquid. 
3. At the end of the day, store tubes of tissue in 4℃. **Tissue will need to be transferred to 70% EtOH within 24-48 hours** but can then be stored at 4℃ for several months.
### F. Sexing and tissue storage
1. Using a sharp scalpel, insert the blade into the oyster gonad
	- Typically creamy in color ==picture==
2. Smear the gametes onto a microscope slide and gently put on a coverslip
3. Under the microscope on the lowest magnification, eggs should be large and circular while sperm will have a less distinct shape and be more dense ==picture==
4. Write on the data sheet M / F / H / NR
	- H stands for hermaphrodite, meaning both eggs and sperm are present
	- NR stands for non-reproductive if there are no gametes present
5. Rinse scalpel, slide, and coverslip in soapy water and dry with a microfiber cloth
6. Store tissue-filled RNAlater tubes in labeled freezer box and record the box number at the bottom of the data sheet
	1. ==Best way to clean them?==
### G. Tissue storage
1. Using a blunt scalpel, scrape off the remaining oyster tissue, including the abductor muscle, into a mini ziplock bag
	- Make sure to check both the right and left shell
2. Put one of the UW paper labels into the mini ziplock bag and then seal carefully
3. Check off "Freeze tissue" on the data sheet
4. Collect all oyster tissue from one site in a large ziplock bag and label (date + site) with a sharpie
### H. Shell pictures and storage
1. Pat the shells dry
2. Place shells on the marine canvas in the marked positions with the UW paper label 
3. Take a picture of both the interior and exterior
4. Put the right and left shell into the same small ziplock bag with the UW paper label
5. Collect all oyster shells from one site in an extra large ziplock bag and label (date + site) with a sharpie
6. Fill in initials on data sheet
7. Rinse empty weigh boats in the sink and let dry upside down on the tray
8. Upload all photos to the appropriate folder in the lab google drive before leaving
