Ambient temperature should be between 15-30ÂºC and constant during testing. 
### Materials
- Enclosed balance that can ideally read to 0.01mg (5 digits)
- Metal weighing tin
- DI water
- Pipettes to be tested
- Unfiltered pipette tips
	- These do not need to be sterile, so best to use already open boxes on bench
- A copy of [this datasheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12iTAoEG-l1v3_EwdWPf6dzEALZ_Db2crj8M9VraPPEo/edit?usp=sharing)
### Steps
1. Take note of the room temperature and air pressure
2. Put the weigh tin onto the balance and add a small amount of water
3. Tare the scale with all the glass sliders closed to prevent drafts
4. Record the ID of the pipette to be tested in the datasheet 
5. Set the pipette to its maximum volume
6. Carefully pipette up DI water, paying attention to the following physical factors:
	- Pipette should be held completely vertical
	- Pipette tip should be immersed in only 1-2cm into the liquid
	- Pipette plunger should be released in a controlled manner to draw up the liquid slowly
7. Dispense the liquid into the weigh tin; fully expel liquid and let the tip of the pipette touch the side of the tin to remove any droplets
8. Record the weight in the datasheet
	- This tells us the *accuracy* of the pipette when comparing to the volume it's supposed to be pipetting; 1mL of DI water should weigh 1g
9. Repeat steps 6-8 at least 3 times, taring the balance after each reading
	- This tells us the *precision* of the pipette when comparing if the replicates are consistent
10. Set the pipette to its minimum volume and repeat steps 6-9
11. Repeat steps 4-10 for each individual pipette

The datasheet will calculate percent accuracy and standard deviation. 100% accuracy and 0mg standard deviation means the pipette is perfectly calibrated.
