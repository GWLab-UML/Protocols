- Clean bench with bleach and set up bunsen burner
	- 2x forceps
	- 1x sterile beaker for forceps
	- 1x sterile beaker for ethanol
- Bleach and RNAse away all surfaces and anything you'll touch in the fume hood (tray, pipette tip boxes, pipettes, homogenizer, etc.)
- Set up liquid and solid hazardous waste buckets inside fume hood
- For cleaning homogenizer probes inside fume hood:
	- 1x beaker for DI

### 1A. Homogenizing samples 

**Perform the following steps on the bench with a lit bunsen burner to ensure a sterile field. Wear a mask to prevent contamination.**

1. Move samples from RNAlater into 2mL tubes making sure to sterilize (ethanol-flame) forceps between samples

**Perform the following procedure in the fume hood. Take precautions to avoid RNA contamination. If Trizol or chloroform spill on gloves, discard in hazardous waste container and get a new pair.** 

1. Using the cold rack, add 500uL Trizol to each sample
2. Insert sterile plastic probe into Homogenizer 150 making sure it locks into place
3. Submerge probe in 2mL tube, hovering just above the bottom; turn on Homogenizer 150 and slide speed 5 clicks to the right, hold for 10 seconds
	- Keep tubes in cold rack while homogenizing but be careful of spillover
	- *Never run homogenizer dry*
4. Carefully remove probe once the homogenizer has stopped and check if any tissue is still intact; if there is visible tissue, repeat step 3
5. Clean probe immediately as follows: run for 10s in DI bath, run for 10s in soapy water
6. Remove probe and leave in soapy water
7. Repeat steps 3-5 for all samples
8. Once all samples have been homogenized, take probes apart and rinse with tap water before submerging them in a beaker of 5-10% bleach—let soak until step 4 of the phase separation (15 minute spin)

Due to the Homogenizer 150 getting hot with use and the potential for RNA degradation, do not exceed 10 samples without resting the equipment. (*untested*)
### 1B. Phase separation 

**Perform the following procedure in the fume hood, except for centrifugation. Take precautions to avoid RNA contamination.**

1. Incubate samples for 5 minutes in the cold rack
2. Add 100uL chloroform and gently invert each sample until thoroughly mixed (bubblegum pink color)
3. Incubate samples for 2 minutes in the cold rack
4. Centrifuge samples at 12,000g for 15 minutes at 4ºC
	- The mixture will separate into a lower red phenol-chloroform organic phase, a milky interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase (~50% of the total volume)
5. While spinning, finish ==cleaning the probes==:
	- Set some kimwipes out in the hood and UV sterilize them
	- Wearing gloves and touching only the top part of the probes that do not come into direct contact with any tissue samples, rinse using DI 
	- Let the probes dry in the hood on the kimwipes and proceed with the protocol
	- Once they are completely dry, take a sheet of aluminum foil and UV sterilize it in the hood; re-assemble the probes before wrapping in the foil to keep clean
6. Carefully pipette out the aqueous phase containing the RNA; avoid drawing any of the interphase or organic layer into the pipette as this will cause phenol contamination
	- Tilting the tube at a slight angle is okay, but keeping the tube more upright will help prevent the phases from mixing
	- Try to remove 150uL of the aqueous phase - less is more! Being greedy = contaminated RNA
	- If aqueous layer is slightly pink in color after initial spin, try spinning again for 5 minutes; if the liquid still doesn't clear up, proceed as normal through steps (Don't panic! It's still possible to get high quality product)
7. Place the aqueous phase into pre-labeled 1.5mL tube and proceed to RNA isolation
8. Store the interphase and organic phase at 4ºC for DNA isolation later the same day

Work can move to the biosafety cabinet/laminar flow hood
### 2. RNA Isolation

**Keep all alcohols on ice throughout RNA isolation. Always use appropriate precautions to avoid RNA contamination:**
- Spray working area with bleach followed by RNase away
- Change gloves as needed

**Precipitate the RNA**
1. Add 0.5uL RNase-free glycogen (want 5-10µg, this is for 20 mg/mL glycogen)
2. Add 250uL of isopropanol, pipette up and down to mix, and incubate in cold rack for 10 minutes
3. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 4ºC
4. Remove the supernatant from the tube, leaving only the gel-like RNA pellet

**Wash the RNA**
1. Add 500uL of 75% ethanol to wash the pellet; vortex sample briefly then centrifuge at 7,500g for 5 minutes at 4ºC 
	- Really want to make sure the pellet is dislodged from the side of the tube and interacting with ethanol, so flick to dislodge
	- Rotate the tube to make sure all surfaces are coated in ethanol
2. Remove and discard the supernatant, going back in with a smaller pipette tip to remove all excess liquid
	- Going back in with a smaller pipette tip (P200) is very important to prevent low 260/230 values—it's worth the extra effort!
3. Repeat ethanol wash step (1 & 2)
4. Air dry the RNA pellet for 5-10 minutes; do not allow the RNA pellet to dry completely 
	- Again, go back in with a smaller pipette tip (P20) to extract any remaining ethanol before solubilization

**Solubilize the RNA**
1. Resuspend the RNA pellet in 30µL RNase-free water by pipetting the solution up and down several times
2. Incubate at 55-60ºC for 10-15 minutes
	- This is a good time to go get liquid nitrogen (or dry ice) to flash freeze the samples
3. Give each sample a good vortex or flick before proceeding to quantification
4. Measure on Nanodrop/Qubit ([calculations spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dncCvx_XR8j56II3qtQBzECOIseynwCOv8T3BreIVWM/edit?usp=sharing))
	- A260/280 = ~2.0 (if lower, likely presence of DNA, protein, phenol, etc)
	- A260/230 = 2.0 - 2.2 (if lower, likely presence of Trizol, phenol, etc)
	- Could also do DNA qubit to double check the majority of your sample isn't contaminated with DNA since Nanodrop won't be able to pick up on this
5. Flash freeze RNA in liquid nitrogen before moving to -80ºC
	- If liquid nitrogen is not available, RNA can be flash frozen with dry ice and 100% ethanol (be careful to not wipe label markings off tubes with the ethanol)
6. Long-term storage at -80ºC
	1. If the downstream application is RNA-seq, treat with [DNase](https://github.com/GWLab-UML/Protocols/blob/5235c06ff8c6466e2f4119e437bf020e83474f65/Molecular_labwork/DNase%20Treatment.md) to remove any potential DNA contamination

### 3. DNA Isolation

**Perform the following procedure in the fume hood, except for centrifugation.**

**Precipitate the DNA**
1. Remove any remaining aqueous phase using a smaller pipette (P200)—this step is critical to limiting DNA contamination, but DO NOT DISTURB THE INTERPHASE
	- If significantly disturbed, consider re-spinning at 12,000g for 5 minutes before trying to remove the aqueous phase again
2. Add 150uL 100% ethanol, thoroughly mix via pipetting up and down, then move to pre-labeled 1.5mL DNA lo-bind tube
3. Briefly vortex each sample before incubating for 2 minutes at room temperature
4. Centrifuge at 5,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC
5. Aspirate out the phenol-ethanol supernatant, going back in with a smaller pipette (P200) tip to remove all excess liquid

Work can now move to the biosafety cabinet/laminar flow hood

**Wash the DNA**
1. Add 500uL of sodium citrate/ethanol solution to each sample
2. Flick each sample until pellet is completely dislodged and suspended in the solution; briefly vortex before incubating for 30 minutes at room temperature on shaker
	- DNA can be kept in sodium citrate/ethanol solution for up to 2 hours (*untested*)
3. Centrifuge at 5,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC 
4. Remove and discard supernatant, going back in with a smaller pipette (P200) tip to remove all excess liquid
	- A pellet may or may not be visible so take care when pipetting
	- If a white precipitate appears continue with protocol and do not attempt to remove; it will likely get smaller with each wash step
5. Repeat wash steps 1-3 again
	- This is a good time to put an aliquot of 8mM NaOH on the heat block
6. Add 500uL 75% ethanol
7. Flick each sample until pellet is dislodged and suspended in the solution; briefly vortex sample before incubating for 2-5 minutes at room temperature
8. Centrifuge at 5,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC
9. Remove and discard supernatant, going back in with a smaller pipette tip (P200) to remove all excess liquid
10. Air dry the DNA pellet for 10-15 minutes; do not allow the DNA pellet to dry completely
	- Go back in with a smaller pipette tip (P20) to extract any remaining ethanol before resuspension

**Resuspend the DNA**
1. Add 15uL warm 8mM NaOH buffer and pipette up and down 
	- For smaller tissues/samples with probably lower concentrations, add 10uL of NaOH instead
2.  Briefly vortex each sample followed by a quick spin
	- If a white, insoluble pellet is still present that is okay
3. Store at 4ºC to incubate overnight (at least 3 hours)
	- Do not let the DNA sit in NaOH at room temperature for longer than necessary as this will result in lower yield
4. Add 150uL TE buffer to bring pH down to 7-8 and briefly vortex
	- If 10uL of NaOH was used, add 100uL TE buffer
5. Measure on Nanodrop/Qubit ([calculations spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dncCvx_XR8j56II3qtQBzECOIseynwCOv8T3BreIVWM/edit?usp=sharing))
	- A260/280 = ~1.8 (if lower, likely presence of proteins, phenol, etc)
	- A260/230 = 2.0 - 2.2 (if lower, likely presence of Trizol, phenol, etc)
6. Long-term storage at -20ºC

*Optional steps*
5. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 10ºC to pellet any insoluble material
6. Transfer the supernatant containing the DNA to a new 1.5mL tube
7. Long-term storage at -20ºC
