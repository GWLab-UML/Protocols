Protocol for oyster histology

*Last updated:* 08/26/2025 by JGM

## Tissue Sectioning

#### Materials:
- forceps
- scalpel and blade
- dissecting scissors

#### Protocol:
For oysters specifically, following the NOAA oyster processing protocol to use their histological sectioning guidelines (parallel blue lines; see below) - dissect tissue, being careful to keep the piece as one as much as possible

## Davidson's Fixative
protocol from NOAA fisheries

*all completed under a chemical fume hood*

#### Materials:
- Glycerin
- Formaldehyde
- 95% EtOH
- NaCl 
- DI water
- Glacial Acetic Acid
- 15mL conical tubes
- 70% EtOH

#### Protocol:
1. To create a **stock solution** of Davidson’s Fixative, add the listed ingredients to a prelabeled 1L plastic bottle with a screw cap. This should be done ahead of sampling days.
	- 100 ml Glycerin
	- 200ml Formaldehyde
	- 300 ml Ethanol (95%)
	- 20 g NaCl in 300 ml Deionized water
2. Rinse graduated cylinder with water under the fume hood then leave in the fume hood to further exhaust fumes and avoid accidental inhalation of fumes. DO NOT take directly to a sink outside of the hood to rinse chemicals.
3. When ready to cut oysters, make a working solution of Davidson’s Fixative by adding the following ingredients to a formalin-safe container intended for sample cassettes.
	- 50mL Glacial Acetic Acid
	- 450ml of Davidson’s Fixative.
	>*Note*: For sample sizes of 50 oyster use 630ml of Davidson’s fixative and 70 ml glacial acetic acid.
4. Add 10mL of Davidson's Fixative (working solution) to a 15mL conical tube under the hood to avoid fume inhalation. Add tissue section to the tube.
5. After adding fixative to the tubes, store for 24-48 hrs at 4℃ (standard refrigeration).
	>*Note:* if the tissue is in the fixative for too long, it becomes brittle
6. Post-refrigeration, transfer tissue to new conical tubes and dispose of the fixative into a designated chemical waste container under the fume hood.
7. Add 70% ethanol to new tubes, transfer tissue and store at 4℃ (standard refrigeration).
	- Label the bottle with the sample details, change in media, date, and initials
		- Sample details (type, number), 70% EtOH, MM/DD/YYYY, initials
	- Tissues are now stable in this condition and can be stored for several months.


## Tissue processing & embedding
protocol from Sean Driscoll, Fish Lab (UML)

**Notes:**
- Make sure you leave enough time for wax to melt in between washes. It will be helpful to prewarm tools you use in the oven to avoid the wax solidifying. 
	- Turn on wax 3 hours before intending to use
- Any step/wash involving wax should be done in a vacuum oven. 
- Washing reagents will be about 15x the volume of the tissue

**Prep specific to UML space:**
- turn on wax machine a few hours before intending to use
- check with Sean/someone in the Fish lab about availability to use their vacuum oven

#### Materials:
- EtOH (95%, 100%)
- xylene or xylene substitute
	- *Note:* xylene is very toxic, so substitute when available
- Parafrost wax
- Cassettes 

#### Protocol:
 
#### Tissue processing:
All ethanol washes can be in the same conical tube - dump ethanol between washes.

1. Dehydrate tissue in EtOH series washed (95%,100%; assuming tissue is in 70% EtOH already - if not, start with lower concentration of EtOH) and all should be on rocker
	> *Note:* The older the sample, the longer the wash the better but should be at least 30 minutes each (ideally an hour or more each).
2. 3 washes in 100% EtOH (about an hour each but can go less) on rocker
	- tissues can be left in 100% EtOH after the third wash indefinitely
3. Wash 50/50 in xylene (VERY TOXIC) or xylene substitute with EtOH on rocker
4. 3 washes in xylene (or substitute), 30 mins each on rocker
5. Place tissue in glass dish or some container that will be easiest to manipulate with the wax
6. 1 wash in 50/50 xylene (or substitute) with wax with vacuum on about 30 minutes
7. 3+ wax washes (need to get the xylene or substitute out) about 30 minutes each (vacuum)
8. Using heat block, transfer tissues into wax mold and embed

#### Embedding:
do this with Stefan the first time - then fill in

## Sectioning 
with microtome

**Notes:**
- Make sure to get trained by someone in the Steinel lab before using the microtome. Also check-in about availability.
- If samples tear while cutting, either the paraffin block is too warm or the knife is dull

**Prep:**
- add 800mL double DI or autoclaved DI water to main water bath and 600mL to the smaller bath on the microtome. Set temperature to ~42ºC. 
	>*Note:* if using for a few hours, water may start to evaporate. It's a good idea to keep extra water near by to refill water baths.
- precool paraffin blocks to 5ºC before sectioning. afterwards, keep in ice bath.
	>*Note:* a warm block will not section properly
- turn on drying rack
- label slides with proper sample identification prior to mounting

#### Materials:
- positively charged slides
- double DI water (or autoclaved DI water)
	>*Note:* at least 1400mL, but should have extra nearby

#### Protocol:
do this with Stefan the first time - then fill in

## Staining - Harris’ Hematoxylin and Eosin2 (HHE2)
*all completed under a chemical fume hood*

protocol is from NOAA fisheries

#### Materials:
- xylene (or substitute)
- 100% EtOH
- 95% EtOH
- Harris Hemtoxylin
- acid EtOH (0.3 HCl in 200mL 70% EtOH)
- NaHCO2 (5g in 200mL DI water)
- Eosin Y-Phloxine B
- Permount (mounting medium)
- Staining holder

#### Protocol:
> Stefan said we could use the Steinel setup for this - do this with him and then edit protocol as needed
1. Remove slides from drying rack.
2. Samples will be hand stained using Harris Hematoxylin and Eosin Y-Phloxine B by moving the staining holder with slides through a series of staining baths using the following procedure:

| Step | Action                            | Reagent            | Time                           |

| 22   | Mount                             | Xylene             | 5min - coverslip with Permount |

#### Coverslipping:
1. With the frosted, coded side of the slide facing up, take a Kim wipe and remove excess xylene from the front and back of the slides, without touching the tissue sections.
2. Place one drop of mounting fluid on the tissue on the slide.
3. Choose the proper coverslip, place the edge of the cover slip at an angle to the bottom edge of the slide, and gradually lower onto the slide so the mounting fluid flows evenly from bottom to top. Do not drop the cover slip onto the slide to avoid bubbles.
4. Blot edges of slide on a paper towel and examine for occasional bubbles. If present, gently lead the bubble to the edge, out from under the coverslip using a probe. Proceed with care to avoid damage to the tissue.
5. Place the slide on a tray with proper labels (code, stain, date) and place in a drying oven set at 38-42℃ for 2-5 days to allow the mounting medium to harden.
6. After hardening of the medium, clean, touch up labels and file slides. Remove excess mounting medium
