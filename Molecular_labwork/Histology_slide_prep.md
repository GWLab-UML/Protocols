*Last updated:* 09/10/2025 by JGM

## Tissue Sectioning

#### Materials:
- forceps
- scalpel and blade
- dissecting scissors

#### Protocol:
For oysters specifically, following the NOAA oyster processing protocol to use their histological sectioning guidelines (parallel blue lines; see below) - dissect tissue, being careful to keep the piece as one as much as possible

## Davidson's Fixative
protocol from NOAA fisheries

*all completed under a chemical fume hood*

#### Materials:
- Glycerin
- Formaldehyde
- 95% EtOH
- NaCl 
- DI water
- Glacial Acetic Acid
- 15mL conical tubes
- 70% EtOH

#### Protocol:
1. To create a **stock solution** of Davidson’s Fixative, add the listed ingredients to a prelabeled 1L plastic bottle with a screw cap. This should be done ahead of sampling days.
	- 100 ml Glycerin
	- 200ml Formaldehyde
	- 300 ml Ethanol (95%)
	- 20 g NaCl in 300 ml Deionized water
2. Rinse graduated cylinder with water under the fume hood then leave in the fume hood to further exhaust fumes and avoid accidental inhalation of fumes. DO NOT take directly to a sink outside of the hood to rinse chemicals.
3. When ready to cut oysters, make a working solution of Davidson’s Fixative by adding the following ingredients to a formalin-safe container intended for sample cassettes.
	- 50mL Glacial Acetic Acid
	- 450ml of Davidson’s Fixative.
	>*Note*: For sample sizes of 50 oyster use 630ml of Davidson’s fixative and 70 ml glacial acetic acid.
4. Add 10mL of Davidson's Fixative (working solution) to a 15mL conical tube under the hood to avoid fume inhalation. Add tissue section to the tube.
5. After adding fixative to the tubes, store for 24-48 hrs at 4℃ (standard refrigeration).
	>*Note:* if the tissue is in the fixative for too long, it becomes brittle
6. Post-refrigeration, transfer tissue to new conical tubes and dispose of the fixative into a designated chemical waste container under the fume hood.
7. Add 70% ethanol to new tubes, transfer tissue and store at 4℃ (standard refrigeration).
	- Label the bottle with the sample details, change in media, date, and initials
		- Sample details (type, number), 70% EtOH, MM/DD/YYYY, initials
	- Tissues are now stable in this condition and can be stored for several months.


## Tissue processing & embedding
protocol from Sean Driscoll, Fish Lab (UML)

**Notes:**
- Make sure you leave enough time for wax to melt in between washes. It will be helpful to prewarm tools you use in the oven to avoid the wax solidifying. 
	- Turn on wax 3 hours before intending to use
- Any step/wash involving wax should be done in a vacuum oven. 
- Washing reagents will be about 15x the volume of the tissue

**Prep specific to UML space:**
- turn on wax machine a few hours before intending to use
- check with Sean/someone in the Fish lab about availability to use their vacuum oven

#### Materials:
- EtOH (95%, 100%)
- xylene or xylene substitute
	- *Note:* xylene is very toxic, so substitute when available - interchangeable in the protocol
- Parafrost wax
- small glass beakers
- Cassettes 

#### Protocol:
#### Tissue processing:
All ethanol washes can be in the *same* conical tube - dump ethanol between washes.

1. Dehydrate tissue in EtOH series washed (95%,100%; assuming tissue is in 70% EtOH already - if not, start with lower concentration of EtOH) and all should be on rocker
	> *Note:* The older the sample, the longer the wash the better but should be at least 30 minutes each (ideally an hour or more each).
2. 3 washes in 100% EtOH (about an hour each but can go less) on rocker
	>*Note:* Tissues can be left in 100% EtOH after the third wash indefinitely in 4℃. ****This is a good stoping point if you need to leave for the day or weekend!***
3. Wash 50/50 in xylene substitute with EtOH on rocker for 1 hour
4. 3 washes in xylene substitute, 30 mins each on rocker (45 mins for larger tissue)
5. Place tissue in glass dish or some container that will be easiest to manipulate with the wax
	1. small glass beakers
	2. Bring tweezers
	3. Gloves 
	4. P1000 and tips
6. 1 wash in (roughly) 50/50 xylene substitute and wax (enough to thoroughly cover tissue) with vacuum on about 30 minutes (45 mins for larger tissue)
	1.  turn on vacuum until the gauge reads 20, then turn off 
7. 3+ wax washes (need to get the xylene substitute out) about 30 minutes each (vacuum; 45 mins for larger tissue) 
	1. add enough wax to thoroughly cover the entire tissue
8. While the tissue is still in warm wax, remove and place tissue into the cassette - then discard the remaining wax

#### Embedding:
0. Tissues can be kept in the warming compartment while waiting to keep tissues from getting hard due to the wax
1. Place a metal dish under the wax dispenser - dispense a small amount of wax into the dish (about ¼ of the dish)
2. Place the tissue into the wax - orient the tissue in the dish
3. Take off the top of the cassette - fill up the dish the rest of the way with wax and put the cassette bottom on the top of the dish (flat side down) - dispense more wax onto the top part of the cassette. (The wax will fall though the holes and make it possible to get it out without the top snapping off) DO NOT OVER FILL! 
4. *Note*: When adding the cassettes on top, the wax shouldn't be high enough that when you seat the cassette on top wax will squish around the sides of the cassette. It should be just seated on top. If it is too high the wax covers the contact points and it will be hard to get out of the tray and the cassette will snap off.
5. Move cassettes to the cooling block for ~20 mins, then can be left overnight at room temperature
	- if not sectioning the next day, cassettes can be stored indefinitely at 4℃ until needed

## Sectioning 
with microtome

**Notes:**
- Make sure to get trained by someone in the Steinel lab before using the microtome. Also check-in about availability.
- If samples tear while cutting, either the paraffin block is too warm or the knife is dull
- Samples in paraffin are good indefinitely and can be sectioned again later

**Prep:**
- add 800mL double DI or autoclaved DI water to main water bath and 600mL to the smaller bath (water reservoir) on the microtome. Set temperature to ~42ºC (Takes about 10 minutes). 
	>*Note:* if using for a few hours, water may start to evaporate. It's a good idea to keep extra water near by to refill water baths.
- pre-cool paraffin blocks to 5ºC before sectioning. afterwards, keep in ice bath.
	>*Note:* a warm wax block will not section properly
- turn on slide warmer (set to 40ºC, setting 4)
- label slides with proper sample identification prior to mounting
- make sure water slide is completely wet/evenly distributed (adjust water speed as needed, higher is needed to start and you can use the paintbrush to evenly get the blade wet. Making sure not to touch the blade but have it this fully saturated.) 
- adjust feed (thickness of slices; ~7 but thicker for fragile tissues) and trim (removing excess wax in front of tissue) with the first dial
- make sure there is no water gap above the blade when sectioning.

#### Materials:
- positively charged slides (or any slide)
- double DI water (or autoclaved DI water)
	- *Note:* at least 1400mL, but should have extra nearby
- paintbrush

#### Protocol:
1. Place cassette into head.
2. Adjust head so the cassette nearly touches the blade (this can largely be done with the second dial, looking above can help determine the angle needed to make it straight)
3. On the trim setting (first dial, hit it twice to change from feed), section the wax until the excess is trimmed off and tissue is exposed. 
4. Switch to the feed setting (first dial) and section.
5. Once sections are floating in the water bath, position a labelled slide under the tissue in the water. (Take out any excess wax you don't want and keep the stage clear) Slowly pull the slide out of the water, making sure the tissue is on the slide. 
	- only leave the slice in the water bath for 30 seconds (the tissue can start to separate)
	- it's okay if the wax goes off the edge of the slide - it will be cleaned off later
	- turn the water slide off to allow for grabbing the section easier
	- multiple sections can be on the same slide 
6. set slides to dry on the slide drying rack for a few hours/overnight
	- can be stored long-term in dry, low moisture environment
7. before starting next sample, move head back and repeat steps above

**to break down microtome:**
1. Put the head all the way back
2. Put the blade protector up
3. Turn water off 
4. Dispose of water in bath/reservoir - dump into bucket to bring to sink - and dry with paper towels
5. Turn everything off - unplug cooler
6. Cover microtome


## Staining with Mayers Hematoxylin and Eosin Y
*all completed under a chemical fume hood*
#### Materials:
- xylene substitute
- 100% EtOH
- 95% EtOH
- distilled water
- Hemtoxylin
- Eosin Y
- Xylene substitute mounting medium
- slide staining holders
- coverslips
- beaker
- parafilm

#### Protocol:
> done in the Steinel lab fume hood - takes roughly an hour
1. Remove slides from drying rack.
2. Samples will be hand stained using Hematoxylin and Eosin Y by moving the staining holder with slides through a series of staining baths using the following procedure:
	- Only alcohols need to be replaced before each use - everything else is replaced as needed. Eosin Y and hematoxylin are parafilm wrapped after use to preserve and prevent evaporation. Since we are using the Steinel labs set up, bring all needed materials upstairs and replace before you start. Bringing a waste container is smart so we don't use their containers. 
	- For slides under running water, transfer slides to bulkier slide holder and place into a beaker. Run water in the beaker for 15 mins.

| Step | Reagent             | Time          |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| 1    | xylene sub          | 2 min         |
| 2    | xylene sub          | 2 min         |
| 3    | 100% EtOH           | 2 min         |
| 4    | 95% EtOH            | 2 min         |
| 5    | 70% EtOH            | 2 min         |
| 6    | Mayers hematoxylin  | 30s (or less) |
| 7    | running tap water   | 15 min        |
| 8    | distilled water     | 30 sec        |
| 9    | 95% EtOH            | 30 sec        |
| 10   | Eosin Y (alcoholic) | 1 min         |
| 11   | 95% EtOH            | 2 min         |
| 12   | 95% EtOH            | 2 min         |
| 13   | 100% EtOH           | 2 min         |
| 14   | 100% EtOH           | 2 min         |
| 15   | xylene sub          | 2 min         |
| 16   | xylene sub          | 2 min         |

3. Once all staining steps are completed, let the slides air dry for a few minutes. Place hematoxylin and EosinY into a labeled storage container and bring back down to the lab. (Good for about 115 slides and they are kept with the ethanol cabinet) (Make sure to fill out data sheet placed on top of the hood)
4. Add a drop of xylene substitute mounting medium to cover the tissue on the slide. Add the coverslip, being careful not to create bubbles. Let sit overnight
5. Slides are ready to be imaged!
