# Qubit Protocol

### Kit Concentration Detection Range
**High sensitivity**
- DNA: 0.1 - 120 ng/uL
- RNA: 0.2 - 200 ng/uL

**Broad range**
- DNA: 4 - 2000 ng/uL
- RNA: 0.5 - 1200 ng/uL

### Prepare for Assay
1. Label tube lids not sides of tube
2. Prepare working solution by dilution HS/BR Reagent 1:200 in HS/BR Buffer ([mm_calculations spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_NJCFvnBztKm_G88Sx-gEKD7CwR44iEaRjyxS_N32E/edit#gid=701799736))
3. **FOR STANDARDS**: 
	1. Add 190 µL of Qubit working solution to each of the tubes
	2. Add 10 µL of each Qubit standard to the appropriate tube, then mix by vortexing 2–3 seconds. Be careful not to create bubbles.
4. **FOR SAMPLES**:
	1. Add Qubit working solution to individual assay tubes so that the final volume in each tube after adding sample is 200 µL.
	    - Your sample can be anywhere from 1–20 µL. Add a corresponding volume of Qubit working solution to each assay tube: anywhere from 180–199 µL.
	2. Add each sample to the assay tubes containing the correct volume of Qubit® working solution, then mix by vortexing 2–3 seconds. The final volume in each tube should be 200 µL.
5. incubate tubes for at least 2 minutes before measuring in Qubit Fluorometer
    - do not hold in hands before putting into fluorometer - warms solution and results in low readings
    - after 2 mins, mixture is stable for 3 hours

### On qubit fluorometer:
1. sign in
2. select mode: "dsDNA High Sensitivity" or "RNA High Sensitivity"
3. re-read standards before reading samples
    - will tell you if standards are bad or if samples are out of range
4. remove tube from fluorometer after every reading. If you need to redo a measurement, take the tube out and equilibrate to room temp for 30s
