### Notes
All steps are assuming 50-100mg starting tissue and 1mL Trizol. Change the following volumes of reagents if changing the amount of Trizol:
- Homogenizing and phase separation: 0.2mL chloroform
- RNA isolation: 0.5mL isopropanol, 1mL 75% ethanol
- DNA isolation: 0.3mL 100% ethanol, 1mL sodium citrate / ethanol solution, 1.5mL 75% ethanol

### 0. Prep
- Bleach and RNAse away all surfaces and anything you'll touch in the fume hood (pipette tips, pipettes, homogenizer, rack, timer, pen, etc.)
- Set up liquid and solid hazardous waste buckets inside fume hood
- Set minicentrifuge to 4ºC
- For homogenizing: set up bunsen burner inside fume hood
- For RNA extraction: set incubator to 55-60ºC
### 1A. Homogenizing samples 

**Perform following procedure in fume hood. Take precautions to avoid RNA contamination.**

1. Move samples from RNAlater into new sterile 2mL tube using sterilized/flamed forceps
	- *Once all samples have been moved, remove bunsen burner from fume hood as Trizol is highly flammable*
1. Add 1mL Trizol to each sample
2. Insert probe into Homogenizer 150 making sure it locks into place
3. Submerge probe in 2mL tube, hovering just above the bottom; turn on Homogenizer 150 and slide speed 5 clicks to the right, hold for 10 seconds
	- *Never run homogenizer dry*
4. Carefully remove probe once the homogenizer has stopped and check if any tissue is still intact; if there is visible tissue, repeat step 4
5. Remove probe and put aside to be cleaned later
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all samples

Due to the Homogenizer 150 getting hot with use and the potential for RNA degradation, do not exceed 10 samples without resting the equipment for 30 minutes. (*untested*)
### 1B. Phase separation 

**Perform following procedure in fume hood, except for centrifugation. Take precautions to avoid RNA contamination.**

1. Incubate samples for 5 minutes at room temp
2. Add 0.2 mL chloroform and shake each sample vigorously by hand for 15 seconds
3. Incubate samples for 2 minutes at room temperature
4. Centrifuge samples at 12,000g for 15 minutes at 4ºC
	- The mixture will separate into a lower red phenol-chloroform phase, a milky interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase (~50% of the total volume)
5. Carefully pipette out the aqueous phase containing the RNA; avoid drawing any of the interphase or organic layer into the pipette as this will cause phenol contamination—slow and steady!
	- Tilting the tube at a slight angle is okay, but keeping the tube upright will help prevent the phases from mixing
	- Try to remove 300-400uL of the aqueous phase
6. Place the aqueous phase into a new 1.5mL tube and proceed to RNA isolation; keep on ice
7. Store the interphase and phenol-chloroform phase at 4ºC for DNA isolation
	- If unable to perform DNA extraction on the same day: remove any remaining aqueous phase, re-centrifuge tubes at 12,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC, use a 200uL pipette to remove any remaining aqueous phase, then store samples at 4ºC for up to a week *(testing from this [protocol](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/protocols/index.php/Extraction_of_DNA_from_TRIZOL_preparations))*

### 2. RNA Isolation

**Always use appropriate precautions to avoid RNA contamination:**
- Work can move to the biosafety cabinet/laminar flow hood
- Spray working area with bleach followed by RNase away
- Change gloves as needed

**Precipitate the RNA**
(Optional: when processing tissue samples <10mg add 1µL linear acrylamide or 5-10µg RNase-free glycogen)

1. Add 500uL of isopropanol and incubate at 4ºC for 10 minutes
2. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 4ºC
3. Remove the supernatant from the tube, leaving only the gel-like RNA pellet

**Wash the RNA**
1. Add 1mL of 75% ethanol to wash the pellet; vortex sample briefly then centrifuge at 7,500g for 5 minutes at 4ºC
	- Samples can be stored in 75% ethanol prior to centrifugation at 4ºC for up to a week *(testing)*
2. Remove and discard the supernatant, going back in with a smaller pipette tip to remove all excess liquid
3. Air dry the RNA pellet for 5-10 minutes; do not allow the RNA pellet to dry completely 

**Solubilize the RNA**
1. Resuspend the RNA pellet in 30µL RNase-free water by pipetting the solution up and down several times
	- Resuspension amount can vary depending on desired concentration—always easier to dilute than to make more concentrated
2. Incubate at 55-60ºC for 10-15 minutes
3. Long-term storage at -70ºC

**Nanodrop RNA** (*optional*)
- A260/280 = ~2.0 
	- If lower, likely presence of protein, phenol, or other contaminants
- A260/230 = 2.0 - 2.2
	- If lower, likely presence of Trizol/phenol

### 3. DNA Isolation

**Precipitate the DNA**
1. Remove any remaining aqueous phase using a smaller pipette—this step is critical to limiting DNA contamination
2. Add 0.3mL 100% ethanol, cap the tube and invert several times to mix before pipetting into a new 1.5mL tube
3. Incubate for 2-3 minutes at room temperature
4. Centrifuge at 2,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC
5. Remove the phenol-ethanol supernatant, going back in with a smaller pipette tip to remove all excess liquid

Work can now move to the biosafety cabinet/laminar flow hood

**Wash the DNA**
1. Add 1mL of sodium citrate/ethanol solution to each sample
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature, periodically mixing by gentle inversion
	- DNA can be kept in sodium citrate/ethanol solution for up to 2 hours
3. Centrifuge at 2,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC
4. Remove and discard supernatant, then repeat wash steps 1-3 again
	- It is unlikely that a pellet will be visible so be careful when pipetting
5. Add 1.5mL 75% ethanol and incubate for 10-20 minutes at room temperature, periodically mixing by gentle inversion
	- Can store overnight at 4ºC
6. Centrifuge at 2,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC
7. Remove and discard supernatant, going back in with a smaller pipette tip to remove all excess liquid
8. Vacuum or air dry the DNA pellet for 5-10 minutes; do not allow the DNA pellet to dry completely.

**Resuspend the DNA**
1. Add 20uL TE buffer
2. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 10ºC to remove any insoluble material
3. Transfer the supernatant containing the DNA to a new 1.5mL tube
4. Long-term storage at -20ºC

(*could also try EB buffer*)

Trying to avoid this part of the protocol...
1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Resuspend the DNA 300-600µL of 8mM NaOH at a concentration of 0.2-0.3 µg/µL</mark>
	- 300-600µL per 50-70mg tissue
	- 8µL 1M NaOH + 992µL water
	- Can store overnight at 4ºC
2. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 10ºC to remove any insoluble material.
3. Transfer the supernatant containing the DNA to a new tube. 
	- The DNA can be stored overnight at 4ºC but for long-term storage at 4ºC or -20ºC adjust to pH 7-8 with HEPES and add 1mM EDTA

**Nanodrop DNA** (*optional*)
- A260/280 = ~1.8
	- If lower, likely presence of protein, phenol, or other contaminants
- A260/230 = 2.0 - 2.2
	- If lower, likely presence of Trizol/phenol
