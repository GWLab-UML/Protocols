### 0. Prep
- Bleach and RNAse away all surfaces and anything you'll touch in the fume hood (pipette tips, pipettes, homogenizer, rack, timer, pen, etc.)
- Set up liquid and solid hazardous waste buckets inside fume hood
- Set minicentrifuge to 4ºC
- For homogenizing: set up bunsen burner inside fume hood
- For RNA extraction: set incubator to 55-60ºC
- For DNA extraction: put 8mM NaOH in incubator to warm
### 1A. Homogenizing samples 

**Perform the following procedure in the fume hood. Take precautions to avoid RNA contamination.**

1. Move samples from RNAlater into new sterile 2mL tube making sure to sterilize (ethanol-flame) forceps between samples
	- *Once all samples have been moved, remove bunsen burner from fume hood as Trizol is highly flammable*
2. Add 1mL Trizol to each sample
3. Insert sterile plastic probe into Homogenizer 150 making sure it locks into place
4. Submerge probe in 2mL tube, hovering just above the bottom; turn on Homogenizer 150 and slide speed 5 clicks to the right, hold for 10 seconds
	- Keep tubes in cold rack while homogenizing and be careful of spillover
	- *Never run homogenizer dry*
5. Carefully remove probe once the homogenizer has stopped and check if any tissue is still intact; if there is visible tissue, repeat step 4
6. Remove probe and put into glass beaker to be cleaned later
7. Repeat steps 3-5 for all samples

Due to the Homogenizer 150 getting hot with use and the potential for RNA degradation, do not exceed 10 samples without resting the equipment for 30 minutes. (*untested*)
### 1B. Phase separation 

**Perform the following procedure in the fume hood, except for centrifugation. Take precautions to avoid RNA contamination.**

1. Incubate samples for 5 minutes at room temp
2. Add 200uL chloroform and gently invert each sample until thoroughly mixed (bubblegum pink color)
3. Incubate samples for 2 minutes at room temperature
4. Centrifuge samples at 12,000g for 15 minutes at 4ºC
	- The mixture will separate into a lower red phenol-chloroform organic phase, a milky interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase (~50% of the total volume)
5. Carefully pipette out the aqueous phase containing the RNA; avoid drawing any of the interphase or organic layer into the pipette as this will cause phenol contamination
	- Tilting the tube at a slight angle is okay, but keeping the tube upright will help prevent the phases from mixing
	- Try to remove 300-400uL of the aqueous phase
6. Place the aqueous phase into a new 1.5mL tube and proceed to RNA isolation
7. Store the interphase and organic phase at 4ºC for DNA isolation (same day)

### 2. RNA Isolation

**Always use appropriate precautions to avoid RNA contamination:**
- Work can move to the biosafety cabinet/laminar flow hood
- Spray working area with bleach followed by RNase away
- Change gloves as needed

**Precipitate the RNA**
(Optional: when processing tissue samples <10mg add 1µL linear acrylamide or 5-10µg RNase-free glycogen)

1. Add 500uL of isopropanol and incubate at 4ºC for 10 minutes
2. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 4ºC
3. Remove the supernatant from the tube, leaving only the gel-like RNA pellet

**Wash the RNA**
1. Add 1mL of 100% ethanol to wash the pellet; vortex sample briefly then centrifuge at 7,500g for 5 minutes at 4ºC
2. Remove and discard the supernatant, going back in with a smaller pipette tip to remove all excess liquid
3. Air dry the RNA pellet for 5-10 minutes; do not allow the RNA pellet to dry completely 

**Solubilize the RNA**
1. Resuspend the RNA pellet in 30µL RNase-free water by pipetting the solution up and down several times
2. Incubate at 55-60ºC for 10-15 minutes
3. Measure on Nanodrop/Qubit ([calculations spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dncCvx_XR8j56II3qtQBzECOIseynwCOv8T3BreIVWM/edit?usp=sharing))
	- A260/280 = ~2.0 (if lower, likely presence of DNA, protein, phenol, etc)
	- A260/230 = 2.0 - 2.2 (if lower, likely presence of Trizol, phenol, etc)
4. Long-term storage at -70ºC

### 3. DNA Isolation

**Perform the following procedure in the fume hood, except for centrifugation.**

**Precipitate the DNA**
1. Remove any remaining aqueous phase using a smaller pipette—this step is critical to limiting DNA contamination, but DO NOT DISTURB THE INTERPHASE
	- If disturbed, consider re-spinning at 12,000g for 5 minutes before trying to remove the aqueous phase again
2. Add 300uL 100% ethanol, cap the tube and invert several times to mix before pipetting into a new 1.5mL tube
3. Incubate for 2-3 minutes at room temperature on shaker
4. Centrifuge at 5,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC
5. Remove the phenol-ethanol supernatant, going back in with a smaller pipette tip to remove all excess liquid

Work can now move to the biosafety cabinet/laminar flow hood

**Wash the DNA**
1. Add 1mL of sodium citrate/ethanol solution to each sample
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature on shaker
	- DNA can be kept in sodium citrate/ethanol solution for up to 2 hours
3. Centrifuge at 5,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC
4. Remove and discard supernatant, then repeat wash steps 1-3 again
	- It is unlikely that a pellet will be visible so be careful when pipetting
	- If a white shard-like precipitate appears continue with protocol; it will get smaller with each wash step
5. Add 1 mL 75% ethanol and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature on shaker
	- Can store overnight at 4ºC (*untested*)
6. Centrifuge at 5,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC
7. Remove and discard supernatant, going back in with a smaller pipette tip to remove all excess liquid
8. Air dry the DNA pellet for 10-15 minutes; do not allow the DNA pellet to dry completely

**Resuspend the DNA**
1. Add 20uL warm 8mM NaOH buffer and pipette up and down until pellet is dissolved, let sit for one minute before quantifying
2. Measure on Nanodrop/Qubit ([calculations spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dncCvx_XR8j56II3qtQBzECOIseynwCOv8T3BreIVWM/edit?usp=sharing))
	- A260/280 = ~1.8 (if lower, likely presence of proteins, phenol, etc)
	- A260/230 = 2.0 - 2.2 (if lower, likely presence of Trizol, phenol, etc)
3. Add 180uL TE buffer to bring pH down to 7-8 
4. Long-term storage at -20ºC

*Optional steps*
5. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 10ºC to pellet any insoluble material
6. Transfer the supernatant containing the DNA to a new 1.5mL tube
7. Long-term storage at -20ºC
