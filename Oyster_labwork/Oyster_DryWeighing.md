## Materials:
- small tins
- fine sharpie
- analytical balance (set to grams)
- drying oven (set to 55-65ºC in Olsen 502)
- blue tray (or equivalent - used to transport and hold tins in drying oven)
- oysters! tissue and shell separate

## Protocol:

### Pre-oven
1. If frozen, take tissue/shell out of freezer to thaw. Save plastic bags to be washed and reused. Shells can be patted dry with a towel or rag if needed. 

#### for tissue:
1. Number individual tins. It's a good idea to 'etch' the number onto the tin for longevity/in case the sharpie wears off.
2. Weigh each tin on the analytical balance. Record empty tin weight in grams.
3. Place each tissue into a numbered tin. Record which oyster samples are in which numbered tins.

#### for shells:
1. Place each shell face up onto a tray with the oyster sample label beneath.
2. Once a tray is full, **TAKE A PICTURE** of the tray (in case the tray spills, you can use the picture to assign samples to shells again)

#### clean-up:
1. For shells, rinse used plastic bags with water and air dry on the bench.
2. For tissue, throw out used plastic bags and labels

### Oven
Place numbered tins with tissues/shells on trays in drying oven. Samples need to be dried in the oven for a *minimum* of 3 days (but can go longer, they won't bake!). Record date of when tins went into the oven.

### Post-oven
1. Remove tins from the oven. Record date removed.
2. Immediately weigh each tin/shell valve and record weight in grams.
    - shell valves are weighed separately - **left** is the cup, **right** is the flat shell.
3. To calculate dry weight of the tissue/shell:
    - total dry weight - empty tin weight = sample dry weight

### Clean-up
1. Return weighed shells to clean, dry bags with corresponding sample labels.
    - For PIC, store oyster shells per site in a bigger bag or cardboard box at room temp.
2. Weighed tissues can be bagged together and disposed of in the trash.
3. All tins are soaked in a bin of soapy water, scrubbed, and air-dried to be reused.
	- Do not leave them in the water more than 24 hours as they will rust
