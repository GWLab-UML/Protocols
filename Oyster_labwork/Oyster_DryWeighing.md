# Oyster Dry Weighing
*last updated: JGM 01/27/2026*

## Materials:
- small tins
- analytical balance (set to grams)
- drying oven (set to XX C)
- baking sheet (or equivalent - used to transport and hold tins in drying oven)
- oysters! tissue and shell seperated

## Protocol:

### Pre-oven
1. If frozen, take tissue/shell out of freezer to thaw. Save plastic bags to be washed and reused.

#### for tissue:
2. Number individual tins. It's a good idea to 'etch' the number onto the tin for longevity/in case the sharpie wears off.
3. Weigh tins on the analytical balance. Record empty tin weight in grams.
4. Place each tissue into a numbered tin. Record which oyster samples are in which numbered tins.

#### for shells:
2. Place each shell onto a tray with the oyster sample label beneath.
3. Once a tray is full, **TAKE A PICTURE** of the tray (in case the tray spills, you can use the picture to assign samples to shells again)

### Oven
Place numbered tins with tissues/shells on trays in drying oven (set to XX C). Samples need to be dried in the oven for a *minimum* of 3 days (but can go longer, they won't bake!). Record date of when tins went into the oven.

### Post-oven
6. Remove tins from the oven. Record date removed.
7. Weigh each tin/shell valve and record weight in grams.
    - shell valves are weighed seperately - **left** is the cup, **right** is the flat shell.
8. To calculate dry weight of the tissue/shell:
    - total dry weight - empty tin weight = sample dry weight

### Clean-up
- Rinse used plastic bags (that stored the tissue/shells) with water and air dry on the bench. 
- Return weighed shells to bags with corresponding sample labels. 
    - For PIC, store oyster shells per site in a bigger bag or cardboard box.
- Weighed tissues can be bagged together and disposed of.
- All tins are soaked in a bin of soapy water, scrubbed, and air-dried to be reused.
