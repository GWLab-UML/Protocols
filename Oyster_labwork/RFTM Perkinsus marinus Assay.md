# RFTM assay for*Perkinsus marinus*
Last updated: 09/10/2025 by JM

### **Materials to autoclave before beginning protocol** (if not already autoclaved):
- Glass culturing tubes with covers 
- 600 mL beaker
- Small beaker (150 mL should be sufficient)
- Container of 25 mL glass pipet tips 
- 5 mL glass pipet tip
- Two stir bars

## I. Preparing the RFTM
### **Materials:**
***Reagents needed for ~500 mL of RFTM:***
>Scale as needed
- 14.6 g FTM powder (Thioglycollate Broth)
- 10 g NaCl
- 485 mL DI water
- 0.25 g Chloramphenicol

***Other materials:***
- 600 mL beaker 
- 125 - 500 mL Autoclavable glass screw cap bottles
- Stir bar 
- Foil or masking tape

### **Protocol:**
*Wear a face mask when weighing out materials with health hazard warning*
1. Add a stir bar to a 600 mL beaker
2. Add 14.6 g FTM powder, 10 g NaCl, and 485 mL distilled water to the beaker in the BSC. Use weigh paper when measuring reagents, not a weigh boat
3. Bring the beaker to a heating stirring table. Set heat to 95℃ and set stirring power to 300-400 rpm until the reagents are fully dissolved. Raise temperature as need, stirring could take up to 45 minutes to dissolve reagents
4. Fill autoclavable screw capped bottles to ~75% capacity for room for heated RFTM, keep bottle caps loose for venting. 
5. Autoclave RFTM at 121°C for 20 minutes
6. Allow to cool before adding 0.25 g chloramphenicol (antibiotic) with stirring, this is now your RFTM
7. Allow RFTM to cool in a sterile environment, like a BSC or fume hood. Once they have cooled to room temp, close the bottle caps tightly
8. Wrap RFTM bottles in foil to keep in the dark in a 4°C fridge (fridge storage allows storage for up to a year)

## II. RFTM inoculation with oyster tissues
### **Materials**
***Reagents needed for inoculation:*** 
- RFTM bottles
- 0.1 g Nystatin (for 100 mL of nystatin suspension)
- 100 mL DI water (for 100 mL of nystatin suspension)

***Other materials:***
- Glass culture tubes
- Stir rod
- Dropper
- 2 pairs of dissecting scissors
- 2 pairs of forceps 
- Small beaker 
- Foil
- Oysters 
- Shucking Knife
- Shucking glove
- Weigh boats
- Dissecting tray
- Plastic bag 
- VMC squeeze bottle

### **Protocol:**
>Be sure to wipe down the bench with 10% bleach before beginning protocol
1. Create a **nystatin suspension** by mixing 0.1 g of nystatin powder with 100 mL of sterile DI water in a beaker. Spin on a stirring table with a stir rod. 
	- 100 mL of nystatin suspension is enough for 180 culture tubes of RFTM. 
	- Store in 4℃ fridge until use. 
2. Label glass tubes with sample ID
3. Add ~10 mL of RFTM to culture tubes using a VMC squeeze bottle filled with RFTM
4. Cap tubes and store in a 4℃ fridge until needed
5. Shuck oyster, being careful not to tear/disrupt the tissues. Dissect needed tissues in plastic weigh boat on lab bench (to reduce mess)
	- *Do not shuck and dissect oysters in the BSC*
	- Ethanol flame forceps and dissecting scissors to sterilize between samples. Allow these to cool before dissecting the next oyster.
	- Place excess tissues and liquid from oyster into a plastic bag to be discarded. Shells can be rinsed with water and kept in 'shell bag' in the bottom of the Narwhal freezer
6. Add 2-4 drops of nystatin suspension into the pre-filled RFTM tube using a dropper to inhibit fungus growth
7. Add dissected tissue(s) to pre-filled and -labeled RFTM tube (mantle and rectum can go in the same tube). 
8. Incubate for 5-10 days in the dark at 27°C (20°C - 30°C is fine). Then proceed to part 3 below.


## III. RFTM assay
### **Materials:**
- Lugol's iodine
- DI water
- Sterile small tip tweezers (4)
- Beaker (2)
- Ethanol
- Ethanol lamp
- Microscope slides
- Microscope coverslips
- Dropper

### **Protocol:**
1. Make 50% Lugols solution and add to a 50 mL falcon tube. 
	>*Note*: Make sure falcon tube is wrapped in foil or dark tape as Lugol's is light sensitive
2. Ethanol flame tweezers and place in a sterile beaker to cool
3. Label microscope slides with a pencil 
4. Add 2 drops of 50% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution to a labeled microscope slide
5. With sterile tweezers, place tissue in the small puddle of Lugol's and tease apart. Don't worry about keeping the tissue intact. 
6. Add another 3-5 drops of 50% (v/v) Lugol's solution (or more if needed to fully stain the tissue). Place a coverslip over the tissue once stained.
7. Examine under microscope for spherical, blue-black *Perkinsus* cells with diameters of 10-100 um. Might appear white with a defined membrane (due to those cells not being stained)
8. Record the dermo score. Refer to the Perkinsus Dermo Score Guide (GW Lab Google Drive > Labwork > Oysters + Algae) - summarized in table below:

| Observation                        | Dermo Score |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 0 *Perkinsus* cell                 | 0           |
| <10 *Perkinsus* cells              | 0.5         |
| 10 < x < 100 *Perkinsus* cells     | 1           |
| 100 < x < 200 *Perkinsus* cells    | 2           |
| Mass of ~200-400 *Perkinsus* cells | 3           |
| < ½ of tissue appears blue-black   | 4           |
| Most of tissue appears blue-black  | 5           |


## Disposing of RFTM
1. Add 50 mL of bleach for every 500 mL of RFTM (a final concentration of 10%)
2. If a hazardous waste container for RFTM has not already been made, make one by labeling it with a hazardous waste sticker. 
3. If there are no more hazardous waste stickers, email biosafety@uml.edu for more stickers
4. Fill sticker out with relevant information: 
	1. Name: (your name)
	2. Department: Bio
	3. Building: Olsen
	4. Rm#: 504
	5. Phone: (your phone)
	6. Contents of container: (list every chemical used) Thioglycollate Broth, Sodium chloride, Chloramphenicol, Nystatin
	7. Check "Other" and write "Biowaste"
