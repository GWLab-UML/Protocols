Algae - 28psu

# Carboy Cultures
Larger volumes of algae to feed out to oysters. Kept constantly bubbling and as sterile as possible since contamination with other algae species OR bacteria is of high concern. As these carboys are actively being used (i.e. algae is being taken out) they will need to be re-bloomed to prevent population crashes and replenish nutrients. 

## Starting a New Carboy
Goals:
- Start fresh with sterile materials and sterile algae
- Replace existing carboy that has been re-bloomed 3-4 times

Materials:
- Carboy, autoclaved
	- **Important:** only the five carboys with volumetric markings are safe to autoclave
- Large rubber stopper with three drilled holes and three hard pieces of tubing, autoclaved
- 2 modified serological pipettes, bleached and rinsed
- 2 long pieces of airline, bleached and rinsed
- 1 short piece of airline, bleached and rinsed
- 2 small airline clamps, bleached and rinsed
- 5 rubber connectors, bleached and rinsed
- DI water
- Instant Ocean
	- 476g per 15L (or 32.5g/L)
- 25mL glass serological pipette, autoclaved
- F/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC
	- 17mL per 17L *total volume* (or 1mL/1L)
- Liquid algae culture
	- 2L depending on density

Steps:
Outside of hood—
1. Measure out Instant Ocean and add to carboy, immediately cover with tinfoil
2. Put carboy on rolling cart and take to room __ to fill with DI water, immediately replace tinfoil
	- Periodically swirl carboy to help dissolve salt

In the hood—
3. Spray entire hood working surface with 70% ethanol
4. Spray all materials except liquid algae culture with 70% ethanol before putting them into the hood
5. Close the hood and turn on the UV light for 5 minutes **DO NOT UV STERILIZE ALGAE**
6. Pipette f/2 media into carboy
7. Pour liquid algae culture into carboy
8. Attach serological pipettes to the bottom of the rubber stopper using rubber connectors, one is for air and one is for siphoning
	- Make sure to attach to the longer pieces of hard tubing; the shorter piece is for the exhaust
9. Put stopper on the carboy and confirm the serological pipettes do not touch the bottom
10. Attach long pieces of airline to the air and siphoning hard tubing coming out the top of the stopper
11. Attach a short piece of airline to the exhaust hard tubing coming out of the top of the stopper
12. Slide on the small airline clamps to the siphoning and exhaust airlines and squeeze them shut
13. Outside of the hood, use the mallet to lightly tap down the rubber stopper to ensure a tight seal

In the oyster room—
13. Place the carboy on the bottom shelf and attach the airline to the air pump system
14. Make sure the carboy is bubbling and then release the clamp on the exhaust

## Cleaning an Old Carboy
Goals:
- Make sure we always have sterile carboy materials on hand 
- Keep the oyster room looking fresh

Materials:
- Power drill, charged
- Rag-pole cleaning attachment
- 5 gallon bucket 
- Bleach
- DI water

Steps: 
1. Take out the rubber stopper and detach all soft tubing and rubber connectors, NOT the three hard pieces of tubing
2. Thoroughly rinse all smaller components in the sink with soap and water, flushing the tubing as best as possible
3. Make up a 5% bleach bath in the bucket using DI water
4. Submerge all smaller components, making sure there are no air pockets in the tubing, let sit for 15 minutes
5. Empty out remaining algae from the carboy into a container and feed this off to the oysters
6. Rinse out the carboy with soap and water 
7. Use the power drill and rag-pole cleaning attachment to really get the stuck-on algae bits off
8. Rinse out the carboy again and let dry
9. Drain off bleach bath while running the tap water to further dilute the bleach
10. Add DI water to the bucket and make sure there are no air pockets in the tubing, let sit for 10 minutes
11. Remove the smaller components, gently shake them dry, and then lay them out to finish air drying
12. Once smaller components are dry, but them away in their respective bins
13. Once the carboy is dry, tinfoil the top and autoclave

# Flask Cultures
Keep more sterile liquid stocks of all algae species in case of carboy contamination or population crash. Should be swirled every day and re-bloomed every week. **When handling the algae at this stage, work in the gray hood and spray things with 75% ethanol to keep things sterile!**

## Re-bloom Flasks
Goals: 
- Keep algae at a happy growth phase
- Replenish nutrients

Materials:
- Flask, autoclaved
	- 250mL flask, max 50mL volume
	- 500mL flask, max 250mL volume
- Instant Ocean
	- 6.75g per 200mL (or 0.0325g/mL)
- DI water
- F/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC
	- 250uL per 250mL *total volume* (or 1uL/1mL)
- 5mL glass serological pipette, autoclaved
- Liquid algae culture
	- 50mL depending on density
- Foam stopper, autoclaved
- Tinfoil

Steps:
Outside of hood—
1. Record how much you plan to split in the [algae flask spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UBeluqx4SQUdaInXP4of0siFTtXhhd97nKfENCC8lmE/edit?usp=sharing) (flask re-blooms tab) and label flasks
	- Species, date, initials, re-bloom number
2. Measure out Instant Ocean and add to flask, immediately cover with tinfoil
3. Add DI water to flask, immediately replace tinfoil
4. Swirl flask until dissolved

In the hood—
5. Add f/2 media to flask and swirl
6. Pipette liquid algae culture into flask and swirl
7. Put in foam stopper and return flask to the bench top, in front of the grow lights
	- Tent a piece of loose foil over the top of the foam stopper to prevent dust settling

Any extra liquid algae culture not used in the re-bloom can be fed off to the oysters upstairs as a snack! 

## Moving from Flasks to Carboy
Goals:
- Grow up algae—let's get them dividing! 

Materials:
- 2L flask, autoclaved
- Instant Ocean
- DI water
- 5mL glass serological pipette, autoclaved
- Liquid algae culture
- F/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC
- Air pump and tubing

# Slant Cultures
Long-term storage of algae species that don't require regular maintenance; can stay at room temperature for 6-12 months. We want to make sure that only algae (not bacteria) grows so make sure all materials are autoclaved and work is done either over a bunsen burner or in the gray hood. These are our most sterile stocks! 

## Making Agar Slants
Goals: 
- Create a large agar surface area within a convenient-to-store glass test tube

Materials:
- Glass tubes with metal caps
- Instant Ocean + DI water
- Bacto Agar
- F/2 media

Master-mix (16 tubes):
- 10mL media per slant (160mL + 20mL extra = <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">180</mark> mL total, 500mL flask)
	- ~4.5g Instant Ocean + 180mL DI water to approximate 28ppt
- 1.5% agar (<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">180</mark> * 0.015 = 2.7g)
- 1:1,000 f/2 media (<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">180</mark>uL)

Steps:
Outside the hood—
1. Use stir bar to help dissolve agar
2. Pipette 10mL of media into each test tube and cover with metal cap
3. Put a small piece of steam indicator tape on each
4. In the metal rack, autoclave tubes on liquid setting for 20min
5. When cool enough to remove, put the rack at 45º angle and allow media to set
6. Once media is set, wrap where the cap meets the glass tube with a small piece of parafilm and store in 4ºC if not using immediately

## Plating Agar Slants
Materials: 
- Set and cooled agar slants
- 1mL dense liquid algae, preferably a new starter culture

Steps:
In the hood—
1. Uncap glass tube and pipette algae culture on top of the solid agar
2. Gently scrape the pipette tip across the top of the agar (create more surface area)
3. Recap glass tube, label appropriately with the date, and replace parafilm
4. Put on bench top in front of the grow lights

## Moving from Slants to Flask
When a liquid flask needs to be started, or if an existing one crashes, we can go back to our slants and start again with a more sterile culture!
