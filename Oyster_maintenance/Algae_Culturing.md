# Our Algae Strains
*Pavlova pingus*
*Tetraselmis sueccia*
Diatom species TBD

Ideal salinity = 28psu

# Carboy Cultures
Larger volumes of algae to feed out to oysters. Kept constantly bubbling and as sterile as possible since contamination with other algae species OR bacteria is of high concern. As these carboys are actively being used (i.e. algae is being taken out) they will need to be re-bloomed to prevent population crashes and replenish nutrients. 

## Starting a New Carboy
Goals:
- Start fresh with sterile materials and sterile algae
- Replace existing carboy that has been re-bloomed 3 times

Materials:
- Carboy, autoclaved
	- **Important:** only the five carboys with volumetric markings are safe to autoclave
- Large rubber stopper with three drilled holes and three hard pieces of tubing, autoclaved
- 2 modified serological pipettes, bleached
- 2 long pieces of airline, bleached
- 1 short piece of airline, bleached
- 2 small airline clamps, bleached
- 5 rubber connectors, bleached
- 15L DI water
- 487g Instant Ocean (32.5g/L)
- 25mL glass serological pipette, autoclaved
- 2L liquid algae culture
- 17mL f/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC (1mL/1L *total volume*)

Steps:

Outside of hood—
1. Measure out Instant Ocean and add to carboy, immediately cover with tinfoil
2. Put carboy on rolling cart and fill with DI water, immediately replace tinfoil
	- Periodically swirl carboy to help dissolve salt

In the hood—
1. Spray entire hood working surface with 70% ethanol
2. Spray all materials except liquid algae culture with 70% ethanol before putting them into the hood
3. Close the hood and turn on the UV light for 5 minutes **DO NOT UV STERILIZE ALGAE**
4. Pipette f/2 media into carboy
5. Pour liquid algae culture into carboy
6. Attach serological pipettes to the bottom of the rubber stopper using rubber connectors, one is for air and one is for siphoning
	- Make sure to attach to the longer pieces of hard tubing; the shorter piece is for the exhaust
7. Put stopper on the carboy and confirm the serological pipettes do not touch the bottom
8. Attach long pieces of airline to the air and siphoning hard tubing coming out the top of the stopper
9. Attach a short piece of airline to the exhaust hard tubing coming out of the top of the stopper
10. Slide on the small airline clamps to the siphoning and exhaust airlines and squeeze them shut
11. Outside of the hood, use the mallet to lightly tap down the rubber stopper to ensure a tight seal

In the oyster room—
1. Place the carboy on the bottom shelf and attach the airline to the air pump system
2. Make sure the carboy is bubbling and then release the clamp on the exhaust
3. Attach a label onto the carboy with the algae species name, date, and source

## Re-blooming an Existing Carboy
Goals: 
- Give the algae more space and nutrients to continue to grow
- Keep the stock as sterile as possible to prevent bacteria contamination (which leads to algae die-off as a result of competition for resources)

Materials:
- 4L plastic algae jug, bleached
- 4L DI water
- 130g Instant Ocean (32.5g/L)
- 4mL f/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC (1mL/1L *total volume*)
- 2 longer rubber tubes that have bleach bathed/DI washed and dried.
Steps: 

Outside of hood—
1. Measure out Instant Ocean and add to plastic jug, immediately cover with lid
2. Fill with DI water, immediately replace lid
3. Swirl jug until dissolved (though its not a full carboy it is easier to swirl halfway and then continue to fill it)

In the hood—
1. Uncap jug, close the hood, and UV sterilize for 5 minutes (with hoses)
2. Add f/2 media and screw on lid
3. You should add the hoses here so it can stay sterile and put tinfoil on the ends. 

**In the oyster room—

(Starting if the car boy is on the second shelf, you need to do the re-bloom on the top shelf, and if on the bottle, then the second shelf is fine because of physics)

1. Looking at the large Carboy that needs to be re-bloomed, you have 3 lines off the top.
- Airline 
- Siphon
- Exhaust
 On your bottle or jug, you have 2….Airline and Siphon.
  
- **IMPORTANT !! Whatever you use in this re-blooming NEEDS TO BE CLEAN AND STERILE!! - As in all rubber connections, all tubes, and once you close the Re-bloom bottle in the hood, IT CAN’T BE OPENED!!! 

1.  Close the exhaust line.
 
2.   Detach the airline from the carboy and attach it to the re-bloom bottle (this is now coming directly from the pump). Make sure the tube is long enough if you need to put it on the top shelf, and ensure air is being pushed appropriately

3. Connect the carboy siphon tube to one of the tubes coming out of the plastic jug lid using a clean rubber connector. (This needs to be initially closed so you don't make a mess.) Open the clip TO THE EXHAUST (This is IMPORTANT!! It will back up into the air line coming out of the carboy, and it will leak and ruin the air filter attached to it). Then, to the siphon tube, and there should be a flow of the contents from the bottle to the carboy. 

4. The contents of the plastic jug should now be flowing into the carboy

5. Elevating the plastic jug will help things move faster (gravity!)

6. When finished, submerge everything in the 5% bleach bath for 15 minutes, followed by the DI bath for 10 minutes, and then air dry before putting all the pieces away. (Follow directions on the wall above the sink for more in-depth directions)**

## Cleaning an Old Carboy
Goals:
- Make sure we always have sterile carboy materials on hand 
- Keep the oyster room looking fresh

Materials:
- Power drill, charged
- Rag-pole cleaning attachment
- 5 gallon bucket 
- Bleach
- DI water

Steps: 

1. Take out the rubber stopper and detach all soft tubing and rubber connectors, NOT the three hard pieces of tubing
2. Thoroughly rinse all smaller components in the sink with soap and water, flushing the tubing as best as possible
3. Make up a 5% bleach bath in the bucket using DI water
4. Submerge all smaller components, making sure there are no air pockets in the tubing, let sit for 15 minutes
5. Empty out remaining algae from the carboy into a container and feed this off to the oysters
6. Rinse out the carboy with soap and water 
7. Use the power drill and rag-pole cleaning attachment to really get the stuck-on algae bits off
8. Rinse out the carboy again and let dry
9. Drain off bleach bath while running the tap water to further dilute the bleach
10. Add DI water to the bucket and make sure there are no air pockets in the tubing, let sit for 10 minutes
11. Remove the smaller components, gently shake them dry, and then lay them out to finish air drying
12. Once smaller components are dry, but them away in their respective bins
13. Once the carboy is dry, tinfoil the top and autoclave

# Flask Cultures
Keep more sterile liquid stocks of all algae species in case of carboy contamination or population crash. Should be swirled every day and re-bloomed every week. **When handling the algae at this stage, work in the gray hood and spray things with 75% ethanol to keep things sterile. ==IMPORTANT: only open one species of algae at a time when working in the hood to prevent cross-contamination**==

## Re-bloom Flasks
Goals: 
- Keep algae at a happy growth phase
- Replenish nutrients

Materials:
- Flask, autoclaved
	- 250mL flask, max 50mL volume
	- 500mL flask, max 250mL volume
- Instant Ocean
	- 4.88g per 150mL (or 0.0325g/mL)
- DI water
- F/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC
	- 250uL per 250mL *total volume* (or 1uL/1mL)
- 25mL glass serological pipette, autoclaved
- Liquid algae culture
	- 100mL depending on density
- Foam stopper, autoclaved

Steps:

Outside of hood—
1. Record how much you plan to split in the [Algae Tracker spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UBeluqx4SQUdaInXP4of0siFTtXhhd97nKfENCC8lmE/edit?usp=sharing) (flask re-blooms tab) and label flasks
	- Species, date, initials, re-bloom number
2. Measure out Instant Ocean and add to flask, immediately cover with tinfoil
3. Add DI water to flask, immediately replace tinfoil
4. Swirl flask until dissolved

In the hood—
1. Add f/2 media to flask and swirl
2. Pipette liquid algae culture into flask and swirl
3. Put in foam stopper and return flask to the shaker in 505

Any extra liquid algae culture not used in the re-bloom can be fed off to the oysters upstairs as a snack! 

## Moving from Flasks to Carboy
Goals:
- Grow up algae—let's get them dividing! 

Materials:
- 2L flask, autoclaved
- Instant Ocean
	- 56.9g per 1750mL (or 0.0325g/mL)
- DI water
- F/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC
	- 2mL per 2L *total volume* (or 1mL/1L)
- 25mL glass serological pipette, autoclaved
- Liquid algae culture
	- 250mL or the whole volume from a dense 500mL flask
- Air pump and tubing

Steps:

Outside of hood—
1. Record how much you plan to grow up in the 2L flask in the [algae flask spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UBeluqx4SQUdaInXP4of0siFTtXhhd97nKfENCC8lmE/edit?usp=sharing) (flask re-blooms tab) and label flasks
	- Species, date, initials, re-bloom number
2. Measure out Instant Ocean and add to flask, immediately cover with tinfoil
3. Add ~400mL DI water to flask, immediately replace tinfoil
4. Swirl flask until dissolved
5. Add remaining DI water to flask, immediately replace tinfoil

In the hood—
1. Add f/2 media to flask and swirl
2. Pipette or pour liquid algae culture into flask
3. Secure a piece of parafilm to the top of the flask

In the oyster room near the carboys and grow lights—
1. Use a clean (bleached) airline and connect it to the main air pump
2. Peel back the parafilm and position the airline into the 2L flask
3. Secure the airline in place with the parafilm and make sure it is bubbling
	- Algae cultures do not need an airstone

Keep an eye on the flasks to make sure 1) parafilm remains secure so there is no evaporation, 2)  airline stays in place and continues to bubble, 3) we have a sterile carboy prepared for when the 2L flask becomes sufficiently dense.

# Slant Cultures
Long-term storage of algae species that don't require regular maintenance; can stay at room temperature for 6-12 months. We want to make sure that only algae (not bacteria) grows so make sure all materials are autoclaved and work is done either over a bunsen burner or in the gray hood. These are our most sterile stocks! **When handling the agar or algae at this stage, work in the gray hood and spray things with 75% ethanol to keep things sterile.**

## Making and Streaking Agar Plates
Goals:
- To take algae from a flask or carboy and isolate colonies that are bacteria-free

Materials for making the plates:
- 500mL flask
	- Size up if volume of DI water is >200mL (there is a liquid autoclave step)
- Graduated cylinder
- Instant Ocean (0.0325g/mL)
- DI water
- Bacto Agar
- F/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC (1uL/1mL)
- Glass petri dishes, autoclaved
- 25mL glass serological pipette, autoclaved

*Master-mix (6 plates):*
- 20mL saltwater per plate + 20mL extra (20 * (6+1) = 140mL)
- 2% agar (140 * 0.02 = 2.8g)
- F/2 media (140mL = 140uL)

Steps for making the plates:

Outside the hood—
1. Weigh out Instant Ocean and add to flask
2. Add DI water to flask and swirl until dissolved
3. Weigh out Bacto Agar and add to flask
4. Use a stir bar to help dissolve agar if necessary

In the hood—
1. Add f/2 media 
2. Cover flask loosely with tinfoil and autoclave for 20 minutes
3. Once moderately cool, start pipetting 20mL into each petri dish, leaving the cover off
	- Because the agar will start to set as it cools you want to do this when the flask is still relatively hot, so be careful!
4. After all dishes are filled, make sure to fully eject all remaining media from the serological pipette so nothing gets stuck once the agar sets
	- If agar does get stuck: fill a 500mL flask with ~200mL water and microwave for 2 minutes, then cautiously (as the water will be very hot) submerge the pipette tip in the and use the pipette gun to expel the softened agar
5. Once the agar is set and cooled, replace glass cover and wrap the edge with parafilm
	- Agar must be completely cool to prevent condensation 
6. Label the plates and store in 4ºC until ready to streak, or proceed with the protocol

Materials for streaking the plates:
- Agar plates
- Small aliquot of algae from liquid culture (<1mL)

Steps for streaking the plates:

In the hood—
1. UV sterilize all the agar plates for 5 minutes
    **DO NOT UV STERILIZE ALGAE**
2. Using unfiltered 200mL pipette tips, pipette 40uL of algae onto the plate closer to the edge rather than in the middle
3. With the same pipette tip, gently streak that droplet across the plate
4. Repeat for each plate, changing tips between each plate
5. Parafilm the plates and put them in the incubator 
## Making and Streaking Agar Slants
Goals: 
- Create a large agar surface area within a convenient-to-store glass test tube

Materials for making the tubes:
- 500mL flask
	- Size up if volume of DI water is >200mL (there is a liquid autoclave step)
- Graduated cylinder
- Instant Ocean (0.0325g/mL)
- DI water
- Bacto Agar
- F/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC (1uL/1mL)
- Glass test tubes and metal lids, autoclaved
- 25mL glass serological pipette, autoclaved

*Master-mix (12 tubes)*:
- 20mL saltwater per slant + 20mL extra (20 * (12+1) = 260mL)
	- Use a 1L flask since total volume > 200mL
- 2% agar (260 * 0.02 = 5.2g)
- F/2 media (260mL = 260uL)

Steps for making the tubes:

Outside the hood—
1. Weigh out Instant Ocean and add to flask
2. Add DI water to flask and swirl until dissolved
3. Weigh out Bacto Agar and add to flask
4. Use stir bar to help dissolve agar if necessary

In the hood—
1. Add f/2 media 
2. Cover flask loosely with tinfoil and autoclave for 20 minutes
3. Once moderately cool, start pipetting 20mL into each test tube, leaving the cap off
	- Because the agar will start to set as it cools you want to do this when the flask is still relatively hot, so be careful!
4. After all tubes are filled, make sure to fully eject all remaining media from the serological pipette so nothing gets stuck once the agar sets
	- If agar does get stuck: fill a 500mL flask with ~200mL water and microwave for 2 minutes, then cautiously (as the water will be very hot) submerge the pipette tip in the and use the pipette gun to expel the softened agar
5. Now rest the tubes at an almost horizontal angle (~10º) so the agar inside creates a nice gradual slope with lots of surface area
6. Once the agar is set and all condensation within the tube has evaporated, recap and wrap with a small piece of parafilm
7. Label the rack and store in 4ºC until ready to streak, or proceed with the protocol

Materials for streaking slants: 
- Agar slants
- Agar plates with algae colonies visible

Steps:

In the hood—
1. UV sterilize all the agar slants (caps removed) for 5 minutes
    **DO NOT UV STERILIZE ALGAE**
2. Using unfiltered 1mL pipette tips, lightly touch the end to a discrete algae colony from the plate
3. Gently streak that pipette tip across the agar surface of the slant, working from the bottom to the top of the slope
	- It is good if the pipette tip etches the agar surface slightly, as this will provide more surface area for the algae to grow
4. Parafilm the tubes and put them on the lab bench to slowly grow

## Moving from Slants to Flask
Goals:
- When a liquid flask crashes, we can go back to our slants to start with a fresh sterile culture! 

Materials:
- 250mL flask, autoclaved
- 1.63g Instant Ocean (0.0325g/mL)
- 50mL DI water
- 50uL f/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC (1uL/mL)
- Slant with visible algae colonies and no obvious bacterial growth
- Foam stopper, autoclaved

Steps:

Outside of hood—
1. Measure out Instant Ocean and add to flask, immediately cover with tinfoil
2. Add DI water to flask, immediately replace tinfoil
3. Swirl flask until dissolved

In the hood—
1. Pipette 1mL of saltwater from the flask into the agar slant
2. Add f/2 media to flask and swirl
3. Rinse the agar slant by pipetting up and down the same 1mL of saltwater until most of the algae is dislodged
4. Add the 1mL of algae into the 250mL flask
5. Put in foam stopper and return flask to the shaker in 505

Once this smaller flask is dense, plan to grow the algae up in a 500mL flask as described in the "Re-bloom Flasks" section of the protocol with these volumes:
- 200mL DI water
- 6.5g Instant Ocean
- 250uL f/2 media
- 50mL algae from 250mL flask
