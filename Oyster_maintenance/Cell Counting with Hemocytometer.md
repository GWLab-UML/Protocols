# Using the hemocytometer
A hemocytometer is a specialized slide used for cell counting with a microscope. Here, you'll find instructions on how to use and clean one, as well as calculate a cell concentration.

### Protocol:
1. Use 70% ethanol for cleaning the coverslip of the hemocytometer before use
2. Gently dry with Kimwipe 
3. Fill a small beaker with lab glassware soap and water and fill another small beaker with DI water
4. Without gloves, swish the hemocytometer in the beaker with soap, take it out, and use your fingers to gently rub the two chambers of the hemocytometer 
5. Repeat swishing the hemocytometer into the soap and gently rubbing with your fingers four times, and after rubbing for the fourth time, swish the hemocytometer in the soap solution one last time and do not touch the surface of the device again as this will leave finger oil droplets that will interfere with the cell count 
6. Rinse the hemocytometer under tap water
7. Swish the hemocytometer in the beaker with DI water 
8. Use Kimwipes to dry the hemocytometer with gentle wiping movements 
9. In the biosafety cabinet, pipette 10 uL of algae into each of the two chambers of the hemacytometer 
10. Count total viable cells (cells with color) in four corner squares and center square 
11. When counting, count any cells on the bottom line and right line of each square 

### Cleaning:
***please clean after EACH use***
- Fill a small beaker with lab glassware soap and water and fill another beaker with DI water
- Without gloves, swish the hemocytometer in the beaker with soap, take it out, and use your fingers to gently rub the two chambers of the hemocytometer
- Repeat swishing the hemocytometer into the soap and gently rubbing your fingers four times, and after rubbing for the fourth time, swish the hemocytometer in the soap solution one last time and do not touch the surface of the device again as this will leave finger oil droplets that will interfere with the cell count
- Do the same with the cover slip of the hemocytometer

### Calculations:

Materials needed for calculations:
- Hemocytometer
- 1 mL tube 
- 20 uL pipet
- 20 uL pipet tips 

To perform calculations: 
- Concentration, aka viable cells per mL = avg # of cells per square * dilution factor * 10^4
- Avg # of cells per square = total # of viable cells / # of squares used
- Dilution factor = final volume / initial volume

### Using Lugol's iodine for algae culturing and *Perkinsus* culturing cell counts:

**Materials:** 
- Lugol solution
- DI water
- 25 conical screw cap tube
- Masking tape
- 1 mL tubes
- 10 uL pipet 
- 20 uL pipet
- 10-20 uL pipet tips 

**Protocol:**
1. If not already made, in a 25 mL conical screw cap tube, create 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution by mixing 3 parts iodine solution with 7 parts DI water
2. Cover the tube with masking tape to prevent light degradation and store in a place away from direct sunlight
3. Label a 1 mL tube "DF 1.1" and with the name of the species that is being counted
4. Start with a dilution factor of 1.1 by adding 2 uL of the 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution to 20 uL of algae in a 1 mL tube. Pipet up and down to mix solution
5. Pipet 10 uL of the solution into a chamber of the hemocytometer and observe
6. Increase the dilution factor by creating a new solution in a new tube if needed

(if counting algae cells for oyster feeding - see the [Algae Tracker spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UBeluqx4SQUdaInXP4of0siFTtXhhd97nKfENCC8lmE/edit?gid=0#gid=0) - just enter the cell count and it auto-calculates concentration)
