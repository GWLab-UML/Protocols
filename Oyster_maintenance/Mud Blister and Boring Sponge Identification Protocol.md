**Note: This protocol should be used after you have taken pictures of the shell's dorsal and Ventral sides. You can have the oysters in front of you to help find all angles when looking for the blisters AND the boring holes!

Graphing the mud blister: 

1. Have one oyster on your screen with image J open; this can be challenging with just one computer, especially if you need to have a spreadsheet open to record it. ( I recommend having two computers.)You need to set the scale for measurements first. ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdpvHmLYheSnywxETdUm2cIti_k2I-UpcZaknNTV8fPFDa1t9zGbh-osLueFhaIWgRFofGi1JELVrdhHLzgZi_Uubo9gNYi-jld_0vbUnMoPqc9ZISrpnVEm_JZkLmYjL8N0WaGog?key=NxgMKdht2JBXN1fmoXucqg)

2. Go draw a line that is one inch on the ruler and then hit “analyze_set scale_known distance:1 ( make sure it changes the unit of length to unit) _global (so you don't have to keep doing this) _ ok.
3.  Place each shell according to whether it is the dorsal side or ventral side of the shell. T for dorsal and B for ventral (you can use whatever you want to represent which shell is what valve). Place the label at the bottom of the shells to know what shells are and what number they are.  This picture will help you identify which side of the shell is which.

4. When scoring them using ImageJ, look at the mantle cavity side of the shell to identify visible blistering and a white overlay of the new shell.
5. This will always come from the sides and go inwards and have a U shape to them, they will always have an entrance and exit. New white shell (raised and a different texture) can be a blister, Black “bruising”, and yellow hue, accompanied by a black blister. NOTE: Oysters have black coloring in the shells, so you need to make judgment calls when looking at them.

4. Each of the circled blisters started at the edge of the shell. 
5. Record the area of the highlighted blisters for each side of the shells. On your spreadsheet, put a column for
	1. Num_blisters_right
	2.  Num_blisters_left
	3. .Area_blister_right
	4. Area_blister_left 
    
Boring Sponge: 

What is it?


Graphing and Identifying the Boring Sponge: 

1. Open ImageJ, just like graphing the blisters, and ensure the scale is set to one Inch. (see above) 
2. Open the folder where your pictures of the shells are saved and start from the dorsal side. We are focused on the dorsal side because it shows the most damage. Having the hand tool ready to move the image to the desired position, and to move it readily. Look at the shell as a whole and note if there is any crumbling of the shell near the umbo. If there is any shell degradation near the umbo, zoom in and see if there are any small holes associated with it.
3. It could be small holes, discoloration (yellow or orange), and “honeycomb patterning”

3. Use the free-hand tool or, for larger areas, use the polygon tool to map out the entire radius and calculate the area. This should be done for both shells, and then log data in columns labeled:
	1. Sponge_area_right
	2. Sponge_area_left
	3. Percent_sponge_right
	4. Percent_sponge_left
