 Mud blister worms—what are they?

*Polydora websteri* are small marine worms that burrow into the shells of oysters and other bivalves, creating mud-filled blisters. The blisters appear as black shadows or as raised patches of pearlescent new shell as the oyster tries to protect itself from the parasite, but it always comes from the edge of the shell inwards creating a U shaped blister. The worm is typically less than 0.75 inches in length and burrows from the opening side of the shell into the main mantle area, Blister worms burrow exclusively into the shell of the oysters because they use it for protective housing, not as a food source. The mud blister worms are researched because of the primary concern is how mud blister worms make oysters and other shellfish less appealing to consumers.

  

### Boring sponge—what is it?

They are a species of demosponge called *Cliona celata* that burrows into the shells of marine organisms such as oysters, clams, and corals, as well as other calcium carbonate structures. As a result of the small circular holes they bore into the oyster shell, weakening them and making them vulnerable to predators or other environmental stressors. With the shell weakened it can can eventually kill the host organism. The small circular boring holes typically originate at the umbo and radiate out towards the edge of the oyster shell. The sponge is studied due to the effect it has on the shell due to the degrading affects on the shell, threatening the oyster industry and the ecosystem of the oyster reef.

  

## 1. Taking shell pictures
### Materials
- Camera/phone 
- Tripod
- A solid colored cloth material
- Should be a color not seen in the oyster shell, easier for processing using macros
- A ruler 
- An external light source (not your camera flash) 
- Label printed on underwater paper with oyster ID information
- Year_Month_Site_Num
- Small ziplock bags
- *Optional*: one set of R and L labels to mark right and left valve
### Preparation

1. Oyster shells must first be cleaned of organic matter and excess tissue using methods such as scrubbing with a stiff brush or steel brush and rinsing with cold tap water
	1. If processing in the lab, it's likely the shells will be frozen and need to be thawed first
	2. If processing in the field, the scrubbing should be done before shucking
	3. If saving the tissue, place that into a different bag and have a label to keep track of what the tissue is and the date.

2.  Attach the phone or camera and adjust the tray so that it fills the whole screen
	Take your tray and cover it with the cloth and set up the ruler on the end of the cloth.
		It can help to place something under the tray to move it closer to the lens if your tripod is long.

3. Set the zoom to 2x or 2.2x , depending on the shell size but have enough room to see details but not squish them to close. They shouldn't be touching any other objects on the cloth.
4. On an iPhone, the square setting provides precise edges to view the entire tray and can be easier to focus on the shells.
5. If you chose to use a identification on each side place each shell according to whether it is the dorsal side or ventral side of the shell. Place the label at the bottom of the shells to know what shells are and what number they are.  This picture will help you identify which side of the shell is which.

1. Pat shells dry to remove any excess water—the glare of the water can cause shadows that will look like mud blisters
2. Position the shells as seen in the example above
3. If using an iPhone, hold the shell on the touch screen that has the most visual contrast between the two on the camera, and let the AE/AF lock (iPhone) and take the photo. 
4. Check the image one last time without moving the camera/phone and then take the picture

- **IMPORTANT!** To save time when analyzing photos, do not move the tripod or zoom in/out between pictures as this will change the scale of the oyster shell! You want the pictures to be uniform and once you like the first picture YOU SHOULD NOT MOVE OR ALTER THE CAMERA. 
5. Flip over the shells and repeat steps 2-4 so you end up with both exterior and interior photos

6. Once all shells have been photographed you should upload to a folder and up to wherever you keep the data. Have a back up so you don't have to do this again later. Label accordingly and upload. 
		If processing in the lab: proceed to the drying section. 
		If processing in the field, store the shells in individual ziplock bags
		Check to make sure to include the ID label, and store at -20ºC.

  

## 2. Drying and weighing

*Note: if shells are coming out of the freezer for this part, they should be completely thawed and dried with a rag/paper towel before proceeding*
### Materials

- Tray
- Photographed oyster shells
- Drying oven
- Weigh boat
- Scale

### Drying

1. Place oyster shells with their unique ID labels on a tray

2. Place top up and all uniform.

3. When the tray is completely full (typically around 6-7 oysters), place the shells into a 55-65ºC drying oven. (If in Olsen the drying oven is in room 502)

4. Rinse out the small ziplock bags and air dry them on the drying rack above the sink (To put them back in the same bags when you are done weighing. Also ***Sustainability :)*** )

5. After 72 hours remove shells from drying oven to immediately weigh

### Weighing
  
1. Place a large weigh boat on the scale and tare the scale

> Do you know which scale Anthony uses? Again, this detail could be helpful to someone! (If you can be extra detailed and try to foresee questions, that will save me from having to answer them in the future haha)

2. Place both valves of an oyster on the weigh boat and record the ID and weight in grams

3. Return the oyster shells and ID label to one of the dry, rinsed ziplock bags; store at room temperature

  

## 3. Photo analysis using ImageJ

  ### Preparation

1. First you should have them relabeled in a folder to make it easy to use imageJ and it will go faster. 

2. Each picture should have a label that matches the site, date and number. *2025_August_site_number*

3. Have a folder for each site and all the picture, it will make it easy to have backups and they are all in the same place. This folder can be uploaded to the drive or where the data is kept.

4. Download and open ImageJ

- *Recommended:* connect laptop to a second monitor or tablet

3. With ImageJ open..![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcrW3rRxNKFWLtoGZpAADOW4BNtGp022thDMxbdMuHe83UPsgS0dSgldhpkWekgNEh9kVBfF4DnfUtfeykMKNv1NZ1-4D-48RTIrsDVpCkjvNuyMVyN_PbwcnRu7j_lfRQDGSdGtw?key=JDzKcoJQwuC_JsCdwCkMPw)

(File>Open>Folder>Image)

4. Go draw a line that is one inch on the ruler and then hit “analyze>set scale>known distance:1 ( make sure it changes the unit of length to unit) _global (so you don't have to keep doing this)>ok. 

5. When setting scale you can check the global button BUT all pictures analyzed in this session must have been taken from the same day with the same camera set up and zoom (or else scale will be different!)![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXceYnf7lRJ71j100syR14-pcs7C0Eajb2DB5W5n44cqRJ9jPs3JaDFDynhw6mKk9MK9SaU1mw1mvWKyNGzYed-gyt6mrvLgqj5KZ-151sIdrAFLBQIgEbcOTRyak4zFsjGjl4lz?key=JDzKcoJQwuC_JsCdwCkMPw)

### General measurements

1. When finding the shell Height and Width you will pick the line tool and start at the tallest point to the umbo on each shell. Then hit M on your keyboard (for measure) and it will pop up with the measurements.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXchSNrq1-Bo9pi22D4i-S3fneV1vuGio122D9MPI9hrVzyXYiizYjTmq90ekIruzMrem4oh_437Y0AOIlnSxaeFRoowXadGcbidUtHgAlZT0ZJ9L1Y7tItBJFynntidkQWKxgDSWw?key=JDzKcoJQwuC_JsCdwCkMPw)

The length you need will be on the far right. (Add measurement to data-sheet and do next shell)

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfPmTA8VdajFhT-3bUM_T2mVKpsz-6LUW-PhO7nI_dyvI9qch0RccsnCYpwwVPSKwSCRLM0kZwy7KEe6aQuvAuc_8UxU6cxxw_RaxupFWYuawDvkwHjoq1Oa86iv8MagcXJO_-h?key=JDzKcoJQwuC_JsCdwCkMPw)

Find the width the same way (find the farthest part and go across and hit M)

The measurement will show up after the first measurement if you don't close it out. (Add measurement to data-sheet and do next shell)

2. When Finding the area you will hit the "polygon" tool and trace along the side of the whole oyster and hit M and it will calculate the data like the length and width. The area of the oyster will be under the Area column and add to data sheet then continue to next shell.

###### Macros 

  

### Mud blister worms

The blisters from the Mud blister worms are pockets of mud and debris located on the inside of an oyster's shell, which bores into the shell. The oyster responds to the “irritation” by secreting layers of shell to build a protective barrier around the worm, forming the blister. When looking at this in the sense of data collection, we are only looking at the dark brown or black U-shaped blister on the inside of the shell. There will always be an entrance and exit to these. Not all shells that have “New Shell” will be a blister, so judgment calls are important. 


1. Open a new file and picture like when you are finding the shell data. 
    
2. (File>Open>Folder>Image)
    
3. Then hit the freehand tool and find a blister and trace the whole outside of the blister. 
    
4. ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfIk0QRDPN30hZAgq8j8nZ3DLySq0ZPmhv5B0Goyl3y9CwWEEzw3FG95Vtzapm5Vhw798_zs-00BBUShm2Qkt8FKMhRPQ5rn3lx6_dCa7rDrYQWh_pLIpdcR6MDiqXq7CAJhoDSNQ?key=JDzKcoJQwuC_JsCdwCkMPw)
    
5. Outlined in yellow are blisters that have a confirmed entrance and exit; the yellow bruising can be from poor water quality, marine parasites, or the age of the shell. It isn't a blister and shouldn't be counted. The yellow arrows pointing to the bright white shell are showing new shell formation, but there is no indication of a blister since you can't see under it, and it could be from any other stressor. DO NOT COUNT IT.
    
6. While the picture has multiple highlights, you can only do one at a time, after each blister hit M and get the measurements, and record the data. 
    
7.  ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcDqgeHH-Ks97DxWY9-lc9O7eOcZI7HB5sE3a1VYYLJgsOTuX2KnN5wEPvhAQvZltU7XevFS0mgbzwDCmTxD-FizIBfh6jDckvn1kZQsT6rcYX7PY_xn8Q0E2065H9y3onUI_QMWw?key=JDzKcoJQwuC_JsCdwCkMPw)

4 . While counting the area, you will also need to count how many blisters there are on either shell. Such as the one above on picture 3.a: it has 8 on the right valve and 2 on the left valve. Record the values on your spreadsheet, put a column for

1. Number of individual blisters per valve

2. Total area of all blisters per valve

### Boring sponge


1. Open ImageJ, just like graphing the blisters, and ensure the scale is set to one Inch. (see above) All steps are the same 

2. Open the folder where your pictures of the shells are saved and start from the dorsal side. We are focused on the dorsal side because it shows the most damage. Having the hand tool ready to move the image to the desired position, and to move it readily. Look at the shell as a whole and note if there is any crumbling of the shell near the umbo. If there is any shell degradation near the umbo, zoom in and see if there are any small holes associated with it.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcub5gkeV_JLK2cAWpgz-T9Qai8MR2y1TSwHMoaREk_nxBJzep-F5VV4TnuhPyFRCFDWA7U3X38dwhWQkrm0Flgj1m-Yzu9L0aSskXCXa8C-vdzBVq3Ko9wq5WJxhTKZOyk16sGqA?key=JDzKcoJQwuC_JsCdwCkMPw)

3. It could be small holes, discoloration (yellow or orange), and “honeycomb patterning.” The yellow arrow pointing at the right umbo is damaged, but there are no small holes or crumbling, and it can't be classified as boring sponge. 

4. Use the free-hand tool or, for larger areas, use the polygon tool to map out the entire radius and calculate the area. This should be done for both shells, and then log data in columns labeled:

5.  Total area of all boring sponge per valve
    
6. The picture below shows the “honeycomb” and yellowing of the sponge on the oyster. The bottom is broken, but it should still be counted because of the damage. 

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfTtF2Rv2ZMq7IPykA5F4G6fa_funRkzD0wP4ZfFsNK576R5E3_GMp4k5ajM4ahoj7lwAAjEkOXRCd_k-HubMqrOLBOBcR0r0bkeojvw30eoH2oquDHDMv-1Yyw1QrQWdMtqAd6TA?key=JDzKcoJQwuC_JsCdwCkMPw)

More example's of boring sponge of boring sponge because it can look different on each shell!
