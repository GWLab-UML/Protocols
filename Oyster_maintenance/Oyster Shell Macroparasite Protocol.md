## 0. Introduction
### Mud blister worms—what are they?
*Polydora websteri* are small marine worms that burrow into the shells of oysters and other bivalves, creating mud-filled blisters. The blisters appear as black shadows or as raised patches of pearlescent new shell as the oyster tries to protect itself from the parasite. The shell can also have yellow bruising around the edges, but it always comes from the edge of the shell inwards. 

> Adding size of worms would be good
> 
> Is the yellow bruising related to the worm? If not, write about it below in the protocol when talking about scoring the images; if so, maybe good to cite a source since I don't think this is widely known
> 
> Reword the bit about coming from the edge by talking about the worm ecology - does the worm burrow into the top of the shell or the side of the shell? Why? 
> 
> Add a sentence about why we might care ecologically, and why the aquaculture industry might care

### Boring sponge—what is it?
They are a species of demosponge called *Cliona celata* that burrows into the shells of marine organisms such as oysters, clams, and corals, as well as other calcium carbonate structures. As a result of the small circular holes they bore into the oyster shell, the shell is weakened and can eventually kill the host organism. The small circular boring holes typically originate at the umbo and radiate out towards the edge of the oyster shell. 

> To push you, when you write the word "demosponge" do you know what it means? You don't have to explain it here, but I just want to make sure you're using terminology that makes sense to you and isn't just what the internet/encyclopedia says (I have no idea what it being a demosponge means haha)
> 
> Does the sponge kill the host, or does the sponge indirectly kill the host due to weakening shell making it susceptible to other pathogens or damage or predation? (I don't think the sponge actually poisons or attacks the oyster tissue but I could be wrong) 
> 
> I got rid of the three classifications of infection because 1) we don't use them and 2) they're not super descriptive haha, it's like no infection, sorta infected, and very infected—it's not more intuitive compared to our percent coverage statistic in my opinion
> 
> Add a sentence about why we might care ecologically, and why the aquaculture industry might care

## 1. Taking shell pictures

### Materials
- Tray

> With the new protocol do you still need a tray?

- Camera/phone 
- Tripod
- A solid colored cloth material
	- Should be a color not seen in the oyster shell, easier for processing using macros
- A ruler 
- An external light source (not your camera flash) 
- Label printed on underwater paper with oyster ID information
	- Year_Month_Site_Num
- Small ziplock bags
- *Optional*: one set of R and L labels to mark right and left valve

### Preparation
1. Oyster shells must first be cleaned of organic matter and excess tissue using methods such as scrubbing with a stiff brush or steel brush and rinsing with cold tap water
	- If saving the tissue place that into a different bag and have a label to keep track of what the tissue is and the date.
2. Once cleaned, they can be placed on a tray with a bench pad to keep them dry. When they are placed on the tray, you can continue patting them dry as best as possible. 
	- You need them as dry as possible so the camera won't pick up on the glare of the water and make a shadow that could be mistaken for a mud blister.

> A simpler alternative for example:
> 1. Scrub oyster shells in cold tap water with a stiff brush to clean off mud and debris
> 	- If processing in the lab, it's likely the shells will be frozen and need to be thawed first
> 	- If processing in the field, the scrubbing should be done before shucking
> 
> I would move the patting excess water to the step where you're actually about to take the shell pictures not here where you're just cleaning them

2. Place your tripod over the tray.

> This doesn't make intuitive sense - place the tripod over the tray? Like suspend it? I would just set the whole thing up and take a picture then say in the protocol "set up tripod and tray as shown below" so you don't have to try to describe it (include external light source so again you don't have to describe it)

3. Attach the phone or camera and adjust the tray so that it fills the whole screen
	- It can help to place something under the tray to move it closer to the lens
4. Set the zoom to 1.7x  or 1.8x, depending on the shell size
	1. On an iPhone, the square setting provides precise edges to view the entire tray and can be easier to focus on the shells
5. Place your R and L labels on either side of the black mat to indicate which valve is which

> Okay now I'm confused haha - are you photographing them on trays or on the cloth? 
> Steps 3-5 needs to be updated accordingly

6. Place the ruler at the bottom of the cloth and make sure it's captured by the camera
	- This is important to ensure your measurements are accurate when using ImageJ later 

### Photographing
1. Place each shell according to whether it is the dorsal side or ventral side of the shell. T for dorsal and B for ventral (you can use whatever you want to represent which shell is what valve). Place the label at the bottom of the shells to know what shells are and what number they are.  This picture will help you identify which side of the shell is which.

> You already said all of this...move the picture to the "preparation" section and call it a day!

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfIRyyaFF2TsNt0Va5cO24zqncdlZAq38tVtxfSHE-cThC2JEYWuzctzaTzE2e18Em4FIzJPhnQ0gAj54VxRCBaRCWjmDPBiWOYoo4_5FpfnwcDNe4OmbPBfHLsVyM6SKzbHiuwlw?key=z_G4b9gy-c2edOMeb05JOQ)**
2. Place the ruler at the bottom of the frame to make sure your measurements are accurate when using ImageJ.

> Already said this too...I also don't think you need this image of the T/B since that is confusing if we are just using R/L (pretend top and bottom don't exist okay, think of how confusing it could be to someone else who is new to this protocol!) I would include this type of picture (retaken with R/L on the different cloth color) and put it right as the first thing of this "photographing" section to be like okay, this is the goal! I would also include an example of an exterior AND interior picture

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfrW4vXaNiapd_ssKQytWMEFghun1pSJaY95r8yha5zBGV6G1Q-R9JWF8mLrNFk8mCkWG0T6lL71262kJoLIljwQStktAWShwmgRudgC8226jG5Xeqtsba3r_HMofBY2GXWca-_BQ?key=z_G4b9gy-c2edOMeb05JOQ)

1. Pat shells dry to remove any excess water—the glare of the water can cause shadows that will look like mud blisters
2. Position the shells as seen in the example above
3. Hold the shell that has the most visual contrast between the two on the camera, and let the AE/AF lock (iPhone) and take the photo. 

> Do you still do this? When you say hold I'm thinking physically hold the shell, but I think you mean touch the touchscreen? If so, I would preface this step by saying "If using an iPhone..."

4. Check the image one last time without moving the camera/phone and then take the picture
	- **IMPORTANT!** To save time when analyzing photos, do not move the tripod or zoom in/out between pictures as this will change the scale of the oyster shell!

> Just want to draw your attention to this point - very important if you use the global set measurement function on ImageJ... Hopefully you haven't been moving or zooming in on the shells when you take the picture? 

5. Flip over the shells and repeat steps 2-4 so you end up with both exterior and interior photos
6. Once all shells have been photographed...

> Add here about how you immediately upload photos to drive! Gotta remember to include all the steps in a protocol, even the less glamorous but arguably most important—all your hard work needs to be backed up somewhere ASAP so you don't have to do it all again haha
> 
> You will probably also want to add a step between 5 + 6 about setting up shots to use the macro with (again, I'd just show an example pic and say do this basically)

If processing in the lab, proceed to the drying section. If processing in the field, store the shells in individual ziplock bags, making sure to include the ID label, and store at -20ºC.

## 2. Drying and weighing

*Note: if shells are coming out of the freezer for this part, they should be completely thawed and dried with a rag/paper towel before proceeding*
### Materials
- Tray
- Photographed oyster shells
- Drying oven
- Weigh boat
- Scale
### Drying

1. Place oyster shells with their unique ID labels on a tray
	- It does not matter if the shells are face up or down!

> If this is wrong correct me, haha, but again, I'm anticipating this to be a question a new user of the protocol would have so best to answer it ahead of time

2. When the tray is completely full (typically around 6-7 oysters), place the shells into a 55-65ºC drying oven in room ??? 

> So I don't think I've been clear enough here - a drying oven is a heated space that has a fan/ventilation to allow things to dry whereas an incubator is typically for cell culture (think algae, bacteria, human cells too) that has water at the bottom to retain moisture
> 
> Add room number as this is also helpful information for a newbie to the lab

3. Rinse out the small ziplock bags and air dry them on the drying rack above the sink

> Yes, this is something I forgot to tell you that we should be doing to cut down on plastic waste... As annoying as it is, it's something I also had to do as an undergrad and should at least make you feel better about ~sustainability~

4. After 72 hours remove shells from drying oven to immediately weigh

> This is also new but important if we are to reuse ziplock bags! 

### Weighing

1. Place a large weigh boat on the scale and tare the scale

> Do you know which scale Anthony uses? Again, this detail could be helpful to someone! (If you can be extra detailed and try to foresee questions, that will save me from having to answer them in the future haha)

2. Place both valves of an oyster on the weigh boat and record the ID and weight in grams
3. Return the oyster shells and ID label to one of the dry, rinsed ziplock bags; store at room temperature

## 3. Photo analysis using ImageJ

### Preparation
1. 
> Add how you re-label photos / organize them on your laptop (do you download them from the drive?)

2. Download and open ImageJ
	- *Recommended:* connect laptop to a second monitor or tablet
3. With ImageJ open...
> Add how you add an image to ImageJ (File > Open > ? or do you drag and drop from a desktop folder? Think of all the questions you asked me or had to figure out and try to concisely address them here - as you know, learning a new software can be daunting and this protocol is meant to help!)

4. Go draw a line that is one inch on the ruler and then hit “analyze_set scale_known distance:1 ( make sure it changes the unit of length to unit) _global (so you don't have to keep doing this) _ ok.

> Like we talked about in person, 1) add a screenshot of the little toolbar and which button you press to draw a line 2) clarify the menus you use by writing the format as Analyze > Set Scale > etc 3) make note of what the user needs to edit "set known distance to 1 and unit of length to inches" 4) add as a separate bullet point under step 4 that you can check the global button BUT all pictures analyzed in this session must have been taken from the same day with the same camera set up and zoom (or else scale will be different!)

### General measurements
1. 
> Add how to measure straight lines for shell height / width (which buttons to draw line, longest/widest point, image example, which buttons to show measurement)

2. 
> Add how to measure the shell area manually 

3. 
> Mention the existence of the macro and I'll check w Sarah but we can either link Teresa's protocol or put some kind of reference here

### Mud blister worms

> Start big picture - are we looking at exterior or interior when measuring mud blisters?
> 
> Tell me which tool to use to trace these polygons
> 
> Instead of "mantle cavity" be consistent with language we're using in this whole protocol - the interior of the right valve
> 
> Explicitly tell people what they are looking for - bullet points are good here and don't get too in the weeds, you already explain a lot of the reasoning in the "what are worms" intro:
> **What are signs of worms**
> - Black or brown blisters coming from the edge of the shell
> - New shell (raised and different texture/pearly)
> **What are *not* signs of worms**
> - Black shell near where the abductor muscle attaches
> - Yellow "bruising"
> - New shell not connected to the edge of the shell
> (this is just an example, add and edit)

1. When scoring them using ImageJ, look at the mantle cavity side of the shell to identify visible blistering and a white overlay of the new shell.
2. This will always come from the sides and go inwards and have a U shape to them, they will always have an entrance and exit. New white shell (raised and a different texture) can be a blister, Black “bruising”, and yellow hue, accompanied by a black blister. NOTE: Oysters have black coloring in the shells, so you need to make judgment calls when looking at them.

> Below each image, add a caption of why you counted what you counted/ your own thought process that will help others differentiate (especially applicable to the bottom photo here, like why didn't you include all of that black/discolored part that seems to touch the area outlined in yellow?) Alternatively, could annotate on your iPad with arrows and such

4. Record the area of the highlighted blisters for each side of the shells. On your spreadsheet, put a column for
	1. Num_blisters_right
	2.  Num_blisters_left
	3. .Area_blister_right
	4. Area_blister_left 

> Again, you need to be more explicit - what buttons do you press to get the measurement once you draw a polygon? How do you clear your selection if you mess up?
> Instead of copy and paste the specific column names, say with words what, for PIC oysters, we are measuring:
> - Number of individual blisters per valve
> - Total area of all blisters per valve
> - Etc

### Boring sponge

> Repeat all of my comments I added under the mud blister worm section to strengthen this part of the protocol too

1. Open ImageJ, just like graphing the blisters, and ensure the scale is set to one Inch. (see above) 
2. Open the folder where your pictures of the shells are saved and start from the dorsal side. We are focused on the dorsal side because it shows the most damage. Having the hand tool ready to move the image to the desired position, and to move it readily. Look at the shell as a whole and note if there is any crumbling of the shell near the umbo. If there is any shell degradation near the umbo, zoom in and see if there are any small holes associated with it.
3. It could be small holes, discoloration (yellow or orange), and “honeycomb patterning”

3. Use the free-hand tool or, for larger areas, use the polygon tool to map out the entire radius and calculate the area. This should be done for both shells, and then log data in columns labeled:
	1. Sponge_area_right
	2. Sponge_area_left
	3. Percent_sponge_right
	4. Percent_sponge_left
