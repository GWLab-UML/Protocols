## 0. Introduction
### Mud blister worms—what are they?
*Polydora websteri* are small marine worms that burrow into the shells of oysters and other bivalves, creating mud-filled blisters. The blisters appear as black shadows or as raised patches of pearlescent new shell as the oyster tries to protect itself from the parasite, but it always comes from the edge of the shell inwards creating a U shaped blister. The worm is typically less than 0.75 inches in length and burrows from the opening side of the shell into the main mantle area, Blister worms burrow exclusively into the shell of the oysters because they use it for protective housing, not as a food source. The mud blister worms are researched because of the primary concern is how mud blister worms make oysters and other shellfish less appealing to consumers.

### Boring sponge—what is it?
They are a species of demosponge called *Cliona celata* that burrows into the shells of marine organisms such as oysters, clams, and corals, as well as other calcium carbonate structures. As a result of the small circular holes they bore into the oyster shell, weakening them and making them vulnerable to predators or other environmental stressors. With the shell weakened it can can eventually kill the host organism. The small circular boring holes typically originate at the umbo and radiate out towards the edge of the oyster shell. The sponge is studied due to the effect it has on the shell due to the degrading affects on the shell, threatening the oyster industry and the ecosystem of the oyster reef.

## 1. Taking shell pictures

### Materials

- Camera/phone 
- Tripod
- A solid colored cloth material
	- Should be a color not seen in the oyster shell, easier for processing using macros
- A ruler 
- An external light source (not your camera flash) 
- Label printed on underwater paper with oyster ID information
	- Year_Month_Site_Num
- Small ziplock bags
- *Optional*: one set of R and L labels to mark right and left valve

### Preparation
1. Oyster shells must first be cleaned of organic matter and excess tissue using methods such as scrubbing with a stiff brush or steel brush and rinsing with cold tap water
	- If processing in the lab, it's likely the shells will be frozen and need to be thawed first
	- If processing in the field, the scrubbing should be done before shucking
	- If saving the tissue place that into a different bag and have a label to keep track of what the tissue is and the date.
2.  Attach the phone or camera and adjust the tray so that it fills the whole screen
	1. Take your tray and cover it with the cloth and set up the ruler on the end of the cloth. 
	- It can help to place something under the tray to move it closer to the lens if your tripod is long.
3. Set the zoom to 2x or 2.2x , depending on the shell size but have enough room to see details but not squish them to close. They shouldn't be touching any other objects on the cloth.
	1. On an iPhone, the square setting provides precise edges to view the entire tray and can be easier to focus on the shells.
4. If you chose to use a identification on each side place each shell according to whether it is the dorsal side or ventral side of the shell. Place the label at the bottom of the shells to know what shells are and what number they are.  This picture will help you identify which side of the shell is which.

### Photographing

1. Pat shells dry to remove any excess water—the glare of the water can cause shadows that will look like mud blisters
2. Position the shells as seen in the example above
3. If using a iPhone, Hold the shell on the touch screen that has the most visual contrast between the two on the camera, and let the AE/AF lock (iPhone) and take the photo. 
4. Check the image one last time without moving the camera/phone and then take the picture
	- **IMPORTANT!** To save time when analyzing photos, do not move the tripod or zoom in/out between pictures as this will change the scale of the oyster shell! You want the pictures to be uniform and once you like the first picture YOU SHOULD NOT MOVE OR ALTER THE CAMERA. 
5. Flip over the shells and repeat steps 2-4 so you end up with both exterior and interior photos
6. Once all shells have been photographed you should upload to a folder and up to wherever you keep the data. Have a back up so you don't have to do this again later. Label accordingly and upload. 

	If processing in the lab: proceed to the drying section. 
	If processing in the field, store the shells in individual ziplock bags
		Check to make sure to include the ID label, and store at -20ºC.

## 2. Drying and weighing

*Note: if shells are coming out of the freezer for this part, they should be completely thawed and dried with a rag/paper towel before proceeding*
### Materials
- Tray
- Photographed oyster shells
- Drying oven
- Weigh boat
- Scale
### Drying

1. Place oyster shells with their unique ID labels on a tray
	1. Place top up and all uniform.
2. When the tray is completely full (typically around 6-7 oysters), place the shells into a 55-65ºC drying oven. (If in Olsen the drying oven is in room 502)
3. Rinse out the small ziplock bags and air dry them on the drying rack above the sink (To put them back in the same bags when you are done weighing. Also ***Sustainability :)*** )
4. After 72 hours remove shells from drying oven to immediately weigh

### Weighing

1. Place a large weigh boat on the scale and tare the scale

> Do you know which scale Anthony uses? Again, this detail could be helpful to someone! (If you can be extra detailed and try to foresee questions, that will save me from having to answer them in the future haha)

2. Place both valves of an oyster on the weigh boat and record the ID and weight in grams
3. Return the oyster shells and ID label to one of the dry, rinsed ziplock bags; store at room temperature

## 3. Photo analysis using ImageJ

### Preparation
1. First you should have them relabeled in a folder to make it easy to use imageJ and it will go faster. 
	1. Each picture should have a label that matches the site, date and number. *2025_August_site_number*
	2. Have a folder for each site and all the picture, it will make it easy to have backups and they are all in the same place. This folder can be uploaded to the drive or where the data is kept.
2. Download and open ImageJ
	- *Recommended:* connect laptop to a second monitor or tablet
3. With ImageJ open...![[Screenshot 2025-08-25 at 3.57.09 PM 2.png]]
	(File>Open>Folder>Image)

4. Go draw a line that is one inch on the ruler and then hit “analyze>set scale>known distance:1 ( make sure it changes the unit of length to unit) _global (so you don't have to keep doing this)>ok. 
	1. When setting scale you can check the global button BUT all pictures analyzed in this session must have been taken from the same day with the same camera set up and zoom (or else scale will be different!)

### General measurements
1. When finding the shell Height and Width you will pick the line tool and start at the tallest point to the umbo on each shell. Then hit M on your keyboard (for measure) and it will pop up with the measurements.
![[Screenshot 2025-08-25 at 4.07.41 PM.png]]
	The length you need will be on the far right. (Add measurement to data-sheet and do next shell)
![[Screenshot 2025-08-25 at 4.08.08 PM.png]]
	Find the width the same way (find the farthest part and go across and hit M)
		The measurement will show up after the first measurement if you don't close it out. (Add measurement to data-sheet and do next shell)

2. When Finding the area you will hit the "polygon" tool and trace along the side of the whole oyster and hit M and it will calculate the data like the length and width. The area of the oyster will be under the Area column and add to data sheet then continue to next shell.

###### Macros 

### Mud blister worms

> Start big picture - are we looking at exterior or interior when measuring mud blisters?
> 
> Tell me which tool to use to trace these polygons
> 
> Instead of "mantle cavity" be consistent with language we're using in this whole protocol - the interior of the right valve
> 
> Explicitly tell people what they are looking for - bullet points are good here and don't get too in the weeds, you already explain a lot of the reasoning in the "what are worms" intro:
> **What are signs of worms**
> - Black or brown blisters coming from the edge of the shell
> - New shell (raised and different texture/pearly)
> **What are *not* signs of worms**
> - Black shell near where the abductor muscle attaches
> - Yellow "bruising"
> - New shell not connected to the edge of the shell
> (this is just an example, add and edit)

1. When scoring them using ImageJ, look at the mantle cavity side of the shell to identify visible blistering and a white overlay of the new shell.
2. This will always come from the sides and go inwards and have a U shape to them, they will always have an entrance and exit. New white shell (raised and a different texture) can be a blister, Black “bruising”, and yellow hue, accompanied by a black blister. NOTE: Oysters have black coloring in the shells, so you need to make judgment calls when looking at them.

> Below each image, add a caption of why you counted what you counted/ your own thought process that will help others differentiate (especially applicable to the bottom photo here, like why didn't you include all of that black/discolored part that seems to touch the area outlined in yellow?) Alternatively, could annotate on your iPad with arrows and such

4. Record the area of the highlighted blisters for each side of the shells. On your spreadsheet, put a column for
	1. Num_blisters_right
	2.  Num_blisters_left
	3. .Area_blister_right
	4. Area_blister_left 

> Again, you need to be more explicit - what buttons do you press to get the measurement once you draw a polygon? How do you clear your selection if you mess up?
> Instead of copy and paste the specific column names, say with words what, for PIC oysters, we are measuring:
> - Number of individual blisters per valve
> - Total area of all blisters per valve
> - Etc

### Boring sponge

> Repeat all of my comments I added under the mud blister worm section to strengthen this part of the protocol too

1. Open ImageJ, just like graphing the blisters, and ensure the scale is set to one Inch. (see above) 
2. Open the folder where your pictures of the shells are saved and start from the dorsal side. We are focused on the dorsal side because it shows the most damage. Having the hand tool ready to move the image to the desired position, and to move it readily. Look at the shell as a whole and note if there is any crumbling of the shell near the umbo. If there is any shell degradation near the umbo, zoom in and see if there are any small holes associated with it.
3. It could be small holes, discoloration (yellow or orange), and “honeycomb patterning”

3. Use the free-hand tool or, for larger areas, use the polygon tool to map out the entire radius and calculate the area. This should be done for both shells, and then log data in columns labeled:
	1. Sponge_area_right
	2. Sponge_area_left
	3. Percent_sponge_right
	4. Percent_sponge_left
