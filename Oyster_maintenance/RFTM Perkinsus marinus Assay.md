Materials to autoclave before beginning protocol:
- Glass culturing tubes with covers 
- 600 mL beaker
- Small beaker (150 mL should be sufficient)
- Container of 25 mL glass pipet tips 
- 5 mL glass pipet tip
- Two stir bars

### Preparing RFTM: 
**Materials:** 
- 1000 mL graduated cylinder
- 600 mL beaker 
- Stir bar 
- Foil or masking tape
- 125 - 500 mL Autoclavable glass screw cap bottles
- FTM powder (Thioglycollate Broth)
- NaCl
- DI water
- Chloramphenicol
- Foil

**Protocol:**
1. Add a stir bar to a 600 mL beaker
2. Add 14.6 g FTM powder, 10 g NaCl, and 485 mL distilled water to the beaker
3. Cover the flask with foil, and set heat to 85°C with stirring power at 300-400 rpm until fully dissolved, raise temperature as needed
4. Allow to cool briefly before adding 0.25 g chloramphenicol (antibiotic) with stirring, this is now your RFTM
5. Fill autoclavable screw capped bottles to 75% capacity for room for heated RFTM, keep bottle caps loose for venting. It is best to have multiple bottles of RFTM rather than one bottle in case any contamination occurs in one bottle
6. Autoclave RFTM at 121°C for 20 minutes
7. Allow RFTM to cool in a sterile environment, like a BSC, once they have cooled to room temp, close the bottle caps tightly
8. Wrap RFTM in foil or tape to keep in the dark in 4°C fridge (fridge storage allows storage for a year)

### RFTM inoculation with oyster tissues

**Materials:** 
- RFTM
- Glass culture tubes
- 25 mL glass pipet tips
- Large grey pipet
- 5 mL glass pipet tip
- Sharpie
- Multiple dissecting scissors
- Multiple pairs of tweezers 
- Nystatin
- DI water
- Small beaker
- Oysters 
- Weigh boats
- Plastic bag with no holes
- Beaker of 70% ethanol 
- Bunsen burner

**Protocol:**

9. UV sterilize tweezers, dissecting scissors, and empty glass tubes with covers for five minutes
10. While tools are UV sterilizing, create a nystatin suspension by adding a stir bar, and 7 parts nystatin powder to 10 parts DI water into a small beaker. 
11. Cover this beaker of nystatin suspension with foil and stir on stir plate until fully dissolved
12. Label glass tubes with important sample and ID information, such as which oyster the sample is from, what species, what tissue type, etc. 
13. Obtain oyster and place them in weigh boat on lab bench to reduce mess
14. Shuck the oyster open
15. If necessary, discard excess liquid from oyster into a plastic bag with no holes to avoid spilling in the BSC. This and all soft oyster tissue contents will be discarded later. 
16. If there are not enough tweezers and scissors for each tissue sample, set up bunsen burner and beaker of 70% ethanol on lab bench. 
17. Using a new pair of tweezers and scissors for each sample, excise tissue samples from oysters and place them into their respective labeled tubes. Ethanol flame tweezers and scissors if necessary. 
18. Bring tubes containing samples into the BSC 
19. In the BSC, aliquot 25 mL of RFTM into labeled glass tubes containing tissue samples
20. Gently add 2-4 drops of nystatin suspension into tubes to inhibit fungus growth. Beaker of Nystatin suspension can be stored in the fridge for future use. 
21. Wipe surface of BSC with 10% bleach after inoculating is finished
22. Incubate for 7 days in the dark at 27° (20°C to 30°C is effective) for an RFTM assay analysis
23. Discard all soft oyster tissue in plastic bag. 
24. Rinse oyster shells and add them into the bag of oyster shells found at the bottom of the Narwhaal freezer

### RFTM assay analysis:

**Materials:**
- Lugol's iodine
- DI water
- Sterile tweezers
- Microscope slides
- Microscope coverslips
- Dropper
- Pencil

**Protocol:**
23. UV sterilize a pair of tweezers and a dropper for five minutes
24. While waiting for tweezers to sterilize, if there is not a 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution already, create 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution by mixing 3 parts iodine solution with 7 parts DI water
25. Label microscope slides with a pencil. Slides are labeled with important sample and ID information, such as which oyster the sample is from, what species, what tissue type, etc
26. Add a small pool of 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution to a labeled microscope slide
27. With sterile tweezers, tease each tissue in the iodine solution apart, add another drop of 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution if needed, and mount a coverslip over the stained tissue
28. Examine under microscope for spherical, blue-black *Perkinsus* cells with diameters of 10-100 um
29. Count and determine if there is *Perkinsus* present and how many cells are present
30. Repeat for each sample and take note of observations
