Materials: 
- Blue Tray
- Camera 
- Tripod stand 
- A solid colored cloth material (to hold the oyster) (a color not seen on the oyster, easier for processing using macros) 
- A ruler 
- Another light source (not your camera flash) 
- T and B on small pieces of paper (to signify which is top and bottom) 
- Underwater paper to label which oyster you have
- Small Baggies to put the oysters in, after/also the tissue. 

Cleaning and Preparation:

1. Debris removal: Oyster shells must first be cleaned of organic matter and excess tissue using methods such as scrubbing with a stiff brush or steel brush and rinsing with water.
	- If saving the tissue place that into a different bag and have a label to keep track of what the tissue is and the date.
2. Once cleaned, they can be placed on a tray with a bench pad to keep them dry. When they are placed on the tray, you can continue patting them dry as best as possible. 
	- You need them as dry as possible so the camera won't pick up on the glare of the water and make a shadow that could be mistaken for a mud blister.

Setup of Camera:

1. Place your tripod over the tray. You may need to place something under the tray to lift it, allowing for a better picture without the need for continuous zooming. 
2. Once you have set up your tripod, attach the camera and adjust your tray so that you can see the entire field of view. 
3. Attach the extra light in a location where it won't get in the way. Do not use the flash on your camera if you are using a phone, as this will result in poor lighting and shadows on the shells. 
4. Once you have the light on and your camera is set up, set the zoom to 1.7x  or 1.8x, depending on the shell size. The square setting on the iPhone provides precise edges to view the entire frame and focus on the shells when you tap and lock the focus. 
5. Place your T and B on either side of the black mat to indicate which shell is which and to make it easier when you look back at them and guess. 
6. Place the ruler at the bottom of the frame to make sure your measurements are accurate when using ImageJ. 


Photographing the shells: 

1. Place each shell according to whether it is the top or mantle side of the shell. T for top and B for mantle. Place the label at the bottom of the shells to know what shells are and what number they are. 
2. Place the ruler at the bottom of the frame to make sure your measurements are accurate when using ImageJ.

3. Hold the shell that has the most contrast between the two on the camera, and let the AE/AF lock (iPhone) and take the photo. 
4. Look at the photo WITHOUT MOVING THE PHONE/ CAMERA! If you move the phone or camera to look at the photo you have to start again and setting it up. Once satisfied, you can flip the shells and take the other side.

Drying Shells:

1.  When the tray is completely full (around 6-7 Oysters), keeping the labels with the oyster pairs, place the shells into the incubator. 
2. This should be set at 55-65℃ 
3. The oyster shells will stay in the incubator for 72 hours! 
4. When finished, you can place the dried shells in another bag and label them, then store them at room temperature. 

Weighing Shells

1. Take pre-dried shells out of whatever container they were placed in
2. Using a scale, place a weigh-boat on the scale and zero the scale
3. Place the shell on the weigh boat. Record the weight in grams to one decimal place
