### **Materials to autoclave before beginning protocol** (if not already autoclaved):
- Glass culturing tubes with covers 
- 600 mL beaker
- Small beaker (150 mL should be sufficient)
- Container of 25 mL glass pipet tips 
- 5 mL glass pipet tip
- Two stir bars

## I. Preparing the RFTM
### **Materials:**
***Reagents needed for ~500 mL of RFTM:***
- 14.6 g FTM powder (Thioglycollate Broth)
- 10 g NaCl
- 485 mL DI water
- 0.25 g Chloramphenicol

***Other materials:***
- 600 mL beaker 
- 125 - 500 mL Autoclavable glass screw cap bottles
- Stir bar 
- Foil or masking tape

### **Protocol:**
*Wear a face mask when weighing out materials with health hazard warning*
1. Add a stir bar to a 600 mL beaker
2. Add 14.6 g FTM powder, 10 g NaCl, and 485 mL distilled water to the beaker in the BSC. Use weigh paper when measuring reagents, not a weigh boat
3. Bring the beaker to a heating stirring table. Set heat to 95 degrees Celsius and set stirring power to 300-400 rpm until the reagents are fully dissolved. Raise temperature as need, stirring could take up to 45 minutes to dissolve reagents
4. Fill autoclavable screw capped bottles to ~75% capacity for room for heated RFTM, keep bottle caps loose for venting. It is best to have multiple bottles of RFTM rather than one bottle in case any contamination occurs in one bottle
5. Autoclave RFTM at 121°C for 20 minutes
6. Allow to cool before adding 0.25 g chloramphenicol (antibiotic) with stirring, this is now your RFTM
7. Allow RFTM to cool in a sterile environment, like a BSC or fume hood. Once they have cooled to room temp, close the bottle caps tightly
8. Wrap RFTM bottles in foil to keep in the dark in a 4°C fridge (fridge storage allows storage for up to a year)

## II. RFTM inoculation with oyster tissues
### **Materials**
***Reagents needed for inoculation:*** 
- RFTM bottles
- 0.1 g Nystatin (for 100 mL of nystatin suspension)
- 100 mL DI water (for 100 mL of nystatin suspension)

***Other materials:***
- Glass culture tubes
- Stir rod
- Dropper
- 2 pairs of dissecting scissors
- 2 pairs of forceps 
- Small beaker 
- Foil
- Oysters 
- Shucking Knife
- Shucking glove
- Weigh boats
- Dissecting tray
- Plastic bag 
- VMC squeeze bottle

### **Protocol:**


1. Create a **nystatin suspension** by mixing 0.1 g of nystatin powder with 100 mL of sterile DI water in a beaker. Spin on a stirring table with a stir rod. 100 mLs of nystatin suspension is enough for 180 culture tubes of RFTM. Store in 4 degree Celsius fridge until use. Adjust volumes as needed. 
2. Label glass tubes with important sample and ID information, such as where oyster is from, the month and year the sample is put in the tube, the oyster number, etc. For each individual oyster, add that oyster's mantle and rectum to the assigned tube.
3. Add ~10 mLs of RFTM to culture tubes using a VMC squeeze bottle filled with RFTM
4. Cap tubes and store in a 4 degree Celsius fridge until usage


**on bench**

Be sure to wipe down the bench with 10% bleach before beginning protocol

4. Shuck oyster, being careful not to tear/disrupt the tissues. Dissect needed tissues in plastic weigh boat on lab bench (to reduce mess)
	- *Do not shuck and dissect oysters in the BSC*
	- Ethanol flame forceps and dissecting scissors to maintain cleanliness between samples. Allow these to cool before dissecting the next oyster unless using previously sterilized and cooled pairs
	- Place excess tissues and liquid from oyster into a plastic bag to be discarded. Shells can be rinsed with water and kept in 'shell bag' in the bottom of the Narwhal freezer



5. Add 2-4 drops of nystatin suspension into the prefilled RFTM tube to inhibit fungus growth using a dropper.
6. Inoculate dissected tissues into their respective culture tube
7. Repeat for each oyster
8. Incubate for 7 days in the dark at 27° (20°C to 30°C is effective) for an RFTM assay analysis
9. Discard all soft oyster tissue in plastic bag. 


## III. RFTM assay analysis
### **Materials:**
- Lugol's iodine
- DI water
- Sterile small tip tweezers (4)
- Beaker (2)
- Ethanol lamp
- Microscope slides
- Microscope coverslips
- Dropper


### **Protocol:**

1. Make 70% ethanol solution and add to a beaker
2. Make 50% Lugols solution and add to a 50 mL falcon tube. 
 Note: Make sure this falcon tube is wrapped in foil or dark tape as Lugols is light sensitive
3. Ethanol flame tweezers and place in a sterile beaker to cool
4. Label microscope slides with a pencil 
5. Add 2 drops of 50% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution to a labeled microscope slide
6. With sterile tweezers, place tissue in the small puddle of Lugols and tease apart. Don't worry about keeping the tissue intact. Add another 3-5 drops of 50% (v/v) Lugol's solution. Add more as needed to fully stain the tissue. Place a coverslip over the tissue once stained
7. Examine under microscope for spherical, blue-black *Perkinsus* cells with diameters of 10-100 um. Might appear white with a defined membrane. This is due to those cells not being stained
8. Indicate the dermo score. Refer to the Perkinsus Dermo Score Guide (GW Lab Google Drive > Labwork > Oysters + Algae) - summarized in table below:

| Observation                        | Dermo Score |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 0 *Perkinsus* cell                 | 0           |
| <10 *Perkinsus* cells              | 0.5         |
| 10 < x < 100 *Perkinsus* cells     | 1           |
| 100 < x < 200 *Perkinsus* cells    | 2           |
| Mass of ~200-400 *Perkinsus* cells | 3           |
| < ½ of tissue appears blue-black   | 4           |
| Most of tissue appears blue-black  | 5           |


## Disposing of RFTM
1. Add 50 mL of bleach for every 500 mL of RFTM (a final concentration of 10%)
2. If a hazardous waste container for RFTM has not already been made, make one by labeling it with a hazardous waste sticker. 
3. If there are no more hazardous waste stickers, email biosafety@uml.edu for more stickers
4. Fill sticker out with relevant information: 
	1. Name: (your name)
	2. Department: Bio
	3. Building: Olsen
	4. Rm#: 504
	5. Phone: (your phone)
	6. Contents of container: (list every chemical used) Thioglycollate Broth, Sodium chloride, Chloramphenicol, Nystatin
	7. Check "Other" and write "Biowaste"
