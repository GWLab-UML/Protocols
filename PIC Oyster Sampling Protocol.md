## Wild oyster sampling
*All water chemistry and samples should be taken adjacent to the oyster bed and done first, prior to oyster collection, to avoid disturbing the water column. Everything should be stored and transported in a cold cooler.*
1. Take salinity, pH, temperature, and DO water measurements using Orion
2. Collect 4x 50mL water microbiome samples (Rep A)
3. Collect another 4x 50mL water microbiome samples at a different spot (Rep B)
4. Collect 2x 100mL surface and 2x 100mL subsurface (1-1.5') chlorophyll a samples using amber glass bottles (Rep A)
	- Keep bottle closed until submerged about elbow-deep, open the bottle to fill with water, recap while still under water at the same depth
5. Collect another 2x 100mL surface and 2x 100mL subsurface (1-1.5') chlorophyll a samples at a different spot using amber glass bottles (Rep B)
6. Take 6x haphazardly thrown quadrat pictures of oyster bed
	- Make sure to keep the camera level and capture the whole quadrat
	- Try to keep shadows to a minimum as best as possible
7. Collect 35 subtidal adult oysters (1.5-3") in mesh bag
	- Try to gather from all around the bed
	- Try not to select for oysters that are more easily removed—use the snips to pry off oysters attached to rocks or other oysters
8. Collect 12 juvenile oysters (<1.5") in small ziplock bag
	- Can be subtidal or intertidal as we're only looking at genetics not microbiome
	- Can be attached to other shells, but only one oyster per cluster should be counted

## Farmed oyster sampling
*Coordinate with farmers ahead of time—text a reminder a week or so in advance*
When we are able to be onsite at the farm:
1. Take salinity, pH, temperature, and DO water measurements using Orion
2. Collect 4x 50mL water microbiome samples (Rep A)
3. Collect another 4x 50mL water microbiome samples at a different spot (Rep B)
4. Retrieve 35 farmed adult oysters from cages
**Note**: we are not sampling chlorophyll a or juveniles at the farms

## Water sample processing
*Wear a mask while working with microbiome samples to prevent contamination*
1. Using a sterile pipette tip and the refractometer, measure and record salinity of replicate on data sheet
2. Rinse refractometer with DI water and dry with a kimwipe
3. Attach 1L vacuum flask to pump and insert glass funnel
4. Using sterile (ethanol-flamed) forceps, place white filter paper on top of funnel and secure using glass cup and metal clamp
	- For microbiome water samples, use 0.22um filter paper
	- For chlorophyll a samples, use 0.7um filter paper
5. Pour one replicate (or total 200mL) into glass cup and turn on the pump
6. Once all of the liquid has been captured in the flask, remove the metal clamp and carefully lift off the glass cup
7. Using two pairs of sterile (ethanol-flamed) forceps, carefully fold the filter paper
	- For microbiome water samples, fold in half four times or until it can fit into a labeled 2mL tube of RNAlater—make sure it is fully submerged
	- For chlorophyll a samples, fold in half once and then carefully wrap in a labeled sleeve of tinfoil
8. Clean the glass funnel and glass cup between each replicate by rinsing it in ~5% bleach  followed by DI water at least twice
	- There are two sets of glass funnels and cups so that while one is drying, another can be used to continue processing
9. Continue steps 1-7 until all water samples have been filtered
	- **Watch the water level in the vacuum flask**—after 3-4 samples it should be disconnected from the pump and the contents dumped down the sink! 
10. Return all microbiome 2mL tubes to the correctly labeled freezer box and collect all chlorophyll a tinfoil sleeves into a Ziploc bag and put on ice
11. In the sink, thoroughly rinse out all the 100mL glass bottles used for chlorophyll a, give them a final rinse with DI water, and then let air dry to be used in the field the next day

## Oyster sample processing
### A. Prep
*Each blue cafeteria tray will have*: (take a picture)
- 1x tube rack
- 2x sets of labeled RNAlater tubes (5 tubes per set—gill, mantle, gonad, stomach, digestive gland)
- 2x paper labels (2 copies per oyster—one to label tissue, one to label shells)
- 2x weigh boats
- 2x data sheets

*Shucking station needs*:
- Sturdy bench top/table
- Trash bag

*Sexing station needs*:
- Outlet to plug in microscope
- Bin of soapy water for dirty slides
### B. Shucking and tissue pictures
1. Using sterile (ethanol-flamed) shucking knives, shuck oyster and arrange face-up on weigh boat
2. 
### C. Tissue dissection
### D. Perkinsus dissection
### E. Sexing
1. Using a scalpel, insert the blade into the oyster gonad
	- Typically creamy in color (take a picture)
2. Smear the creamy gametes onto a microscope slide and gently put on a coverslip
3. Under the microscope, the eggs should be larger and circular whereas the sperm will be much smaller and almost look like...pixelated/granulated snaking water (take pictures)
4. Write on the data sheet M / F / H / NR
	- H stands for hermaphrodite, meaning both eggs and sperm are present
	- NR stands for non-reproductive if there are no gametes present
5. Put used slide and coverslip into the bin of soapy water to soak
6. Rinse the scalpel in the bin of soapy water and dry with a kimwipe
7. After all samples have been processed, rinse all the slides and coverslips with DI and then set them out on paper towels to dry overnight
### F. Tissue storage
### G. Shell pictures and storage
