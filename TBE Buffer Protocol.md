### TBE Buffer 10x Stock Recipe
- 108 g [tris base](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/substance/trizmabase1211477861)
- 55 g [boric acid](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/substance/boricacid618310043353)
- 900 ml double-distilled H2O
- 40 ml 0.5 M [EDTA](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/substance/ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid2922460004) solution (pH 8.0)
Adjust volume to 1 L.

### 1x TBE Preparation
Dilute 10x concentrated TBE buffer 10-fold with ultrapure water.
The final solution should contain:
- 0.13 M [tris](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/substance/trizmabase1211477861) (pH 7.6)
- 45 mM [boric acid](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/substance/boricacid618310043353)
- 2.5 mM [EDTA](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/substance/ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid2922460004)

### Buffer Prep Tips
- If precipitation is present, warm to 37 °C and mix until completely dissolved prior to dilution.  
- It is recommended 1x working solutions be filtered through a 0.2 mm filter before use.
- 1x working solutions can be used until the expiration date on packaging with storage at room temperature. Discard if buffer becomes cloudy or discolored.

**Stock Solution of EDTA** 
An EDTA solution should be prepared ahead of time. EDTA will not go completely into the solution until the pH is adjusted to about 8.0. 
For a 500-milliliter stock solution of 0.5 M EDTA:
- weigh out 93.05 grams of EDTA disodium salt (FW = 372.2)
- dissolve it in 400 milliliters of deionized water
- adjust the pH with NaOH (sodium hydroxide) - pH needs to be ~8.0
- top up the solution to a final volume of 500 milliliters.

**Stock Solution of TBE**
Make a concentrated (5x) stock solution of TBE by 
- weighing 54 grams of Tris base (FW = 121.14) and 27.5 grams of boric acid (FW = 61.83) 
- dissolving both in approximately 900 milliliters of deionized water 
- add 20 milliliters of 0.5 M (molarity, or the concentration) EDTA (pH 8.0) and adjust the solution to a final volume of 1 liter. 
This solution can be stored at room temperature but a precipitate will form in older solutions. Store the buffer in glass bottles and discard if a precipitate has formed.

**Working Solution of TBE**
For agarose gel electrophoresis, a TBE buffer can be used at a concentration of 0.5x (1:10 dilution of the concentrated stock). Dilute the stock solution by 10x in deionized water. Final solute concentrations are 45 mM Tris-borate and 1 mM (millimolar) EDTA. The buffer is now ready for use in [running an agarose gel](https://www.thoughtco.com/visualizing-dna-375499).
