### Notes
All steps are assuming 50-100mg starting tissue and 1mL Trizol (may want to decrease to 500µL)
- Homogenizing and phase separation: 0.2mL chloroform
- RNA isolation: 0.5mL isopropanol, 1mL 75% ethanol
- DNA isolation: 0.3mL 100% ethanol, 1mL sodium citrate / ethanol solution, 1.5mL 75% ethanol
### Materials
- Trizol
- Chloroform
- Homogenizer 150
- Plastic homogenizer probes
- 100% isopropanol
- 75% ethanol
- 100% ethanol
- RNase-free water (molecular grade)
- Sodium citrate (0.1M in 10% ethanol, pH 8.5)
	- to make 1M sodium citrate:
		- 24.9g sodium citrate dissolved in 100mL of molecular grade water
		- autoclaved at 121ºC for 20 mins
	- to make 0.1M in 10% ethanol:
		- 10mL 100% EtOH
		- 10mL 1M sodium citrate solution
		- 80mL in molecular grade water
		*store at room temp - good for several months*
- 8mM sodium hydroxide
- RNase away
- RNA-free 2mL tubes
- RNA-free 1.5mL tubes
### 0. Prep
- Prepare ventilated safety hood with diaper paper and bleach tray
- bleach and RNAse away all surfaces and anything you'll touch (pipette tips, pipettes, timer, pen, etc.)
- set up liquid and solid hazardous waste buckets inside fume hood
- Set minicentrifuge to 4ºC
- Set incubator to 55-60ºC
- Make up sodium citrate / ethanol solution
	- 0.1M sodium citrate in 10% ethanol, pH 8.5
### 1A. Homogenizing samples 

**Perform following procedure in ventilated safety hood. Keep samples on ice.**

1. Move sample from RNAlater into new sterile 2mL tube using sterilized/flamed forceps
2. Add 1mL Trizol to sample.
	1. could also add 500uL of Trizol, homogenize, then add the rest of the 500uL if worried of overflowing the tube
3. Insert homogenizer probe into Homogenizer 150 making sure it locks into place. 
4. Submerge probe in 2mL tube, hovering just above the bottom. Turn on Homogenizer 150 and slide speed 5 clicks to the right, hold for 10 seconds.
	- Never run homogenizer dry
5. Carefully remove probe once the homogenizer has stopped and check if any tissue is still intact
	- If there is still visible tissue, repeat step 4
6. Close tube and set aside. Remove used probe, separating the clear sheath and the blue piston, and put both in a beaker of 10% bleach to soak. 

Due to the Homogenizer 150 getting hot with use and the potential for RNA degradation, do not exceed __ samples without resting the equipment for 1 hour (?).

### 1B. Phase separation 

**Perform following procedure in ventilated safety hood, except for centrifugation.**

1. After all samples have been homogenized, incubate them for 5 minutes at room temperature.
2. Add 0.2 mL chloroform and cap tube securely. Shake vigorously by hand for 15 seconds. Incubate for 2-3 minutes at room temperature. 
3. Centrifuge samples at 12,000g for 15 minutes at 4ºC.
	- The mixture will separate into a lower red phenol-chloroform phase, an interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase (~50% of the total volume)
4. Remove the aqueous phase containing the RNA - a slight angle is okay to carefully pipette the solution out, but it's easier to keep the tube as upright as possible to prevent the phases from mixing. Avoid drawing any of the interphase or organic layer into the pipette - slow and steady!
	1. ~400uL of upper phase was collected for oyster tissue
5. Place the aqueous phase into a new 1.5mL tube. Store the interphase and organic phenol-chloroform phase for at 4ºC for DNA isolation later, ideally on the same day. 

### 2. RNA Isolation

**Always use appropriate precautions to avoid RNA contamination:**
- work can move to the biosafety cabinet now
- Spray working area with bleach followed by RNase away
- Change gloves as needed

**Precipitate the RNA**
(Optional: when processing tissue samples <10mg add 1µL linear acrylamide or 5-10µg RNase-free glycogen)

1. Add 500uL of isopropanol and incubate at 4ºC for 10 minutes.
2. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 4ºC. 
3. Remove the supernatant from the tube, leaving only the gel-like RNA pellet.

**Wash the RNA**
1. Add 1mL of 75% ethanol to wash the pellet. Vortex sample briefly, centrifuge at 7,500g for 5 minutes at 4ºC. 
	- Sample can be stored in 75% ethanol prior to centrifugation for 1 week at 4ºC
2. Remove and discard the wash, going back in with a smaller pipette tip to remove excess liquid. 
3. Vacuum or air dry the RNA pellet for 5-10 minutes. Do not allow the RNA pellet to dry completely 

**Solubilize the RNA**
1. Resuspend the RNA pellet in 30µL RNase-free water by pipetting the solution up and down several times.
	1. resuspension amount can vary depending on desired concentration - always easier to dilute than to make more concentrated
2. Incubate at 55-60ºC for 10-15 minutes.

*Optional:* Quantify/quality check RNA
with Nanodrop:
- A260/280 = ~2.0 
	- if lower, likely presence of protein, phenol or other contaminants
- A260/230 = 2.0 - 2.2
	- if lower, likely presence of Trizol reagent

Store samples at -70ºC

### 3. DNA Isolation
*>1hr total incubation time*

**DNA precipitation**
1. Remove any remaining aqueous phase overlying the interphase—this is critical for the quality of isolated DNA.
2. Add 0.3mL 100% ethanol. Cap the tube and invert several times to mix. Incubate for 2-3 minutes at room temperature.
3. Centrifuge at 2,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC.
4. Remove the phenol-ethanol supernatant.

**DNA wash**
1. Add 1mL of sodium citrate / ethanol solution to wash the pellet. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature, periodically mixing by gentle inversion.
	- **Note:** DNA can be kept in sodium citrate / ethanol solution for 2 hours
2. Centrifuge at 2,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC. Remove and discard supernatant. 
3. Repeat wash steps 5-6 once.
4. Add 1.5mL 75% ethanol and incubate for 10-20 minutes at room temperature. Gently invert tubes occasionally. 
	- Can store overnight at 4ºC
5. Centrifuge at 2,000g for 5 minutes at 4ºC. Remove and discard supernatant.
6. Vacuum or air dry the DNA pellet for 5-10 minutes. Do not allow the DNA pellet to dry completely.

**DNA resuspension**
1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Resuspend the DNA 300-600µL of 8mM NaOH at a concentration of 0.2-0.3 µg/µL</mark>
	- 300-600µL per 50-70mg tissue
	- 8µL 1M NaOH + 992µL water
	- Can store overnight at 4ºC
2. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 10ºC to remove any insoluble material.
3. Transfer the supernatant containing the DNA to a new tube. 
	- The DNA can be stored overnight at 4ºC but for long-term storage at 4ºC or -20ºC adjust to pH 7-8 with HEPES and add 1mM EDTA
